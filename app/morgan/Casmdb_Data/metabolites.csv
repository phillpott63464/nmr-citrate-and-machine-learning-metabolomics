Methylamino acids are primarily proteogenic amino acids (found in proteins) which have been methylated (in situ) on their side chains by various methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine can be methylated at either the N1 or N3 position of its imidazole ring, yielding the isomers 1-methylhistidine (1MH; also referred to as pi-methylhistidine) or 3-methylhistidine (3MH; tau-methylhistidine), respectively. There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (Npi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH (PMID: 24137022).  Recent discoveries have shown that 1MH is produced in essentially all mammals (and other vertebrates) via the enzyme known as METTL9 (PMID: 33563959). METTL9 is a broad-specificity methyltransferase that mediates the formation of the majority of 1MH present in mammalian proteomes. METTL9-catalyzed methylation requires a His-x-His (HxH) motif, where ""x"" is a small amino acid. This HxH motif is found in a number of abundant mammalian proteins such as ARMC6, S100A9, and NDUFB3 (PMID: 33563959). Because of its abundance in many muscle-related proteins, 1MH has been found to be a good biomarker for the consumption of meat (PMID: 21527577). Dietary studies have shown that poultry consumption (p-trend = 0.0006) and chicken consumption (p-trend = 0.0003) are associated with increased levels of 1MH in human plasma (PMID: 30018457). The consumption of fish, especially salmon and cod, has also been shown to increase the levels of 1MH in serum and urine (PMID: 31401679). As a general rule, urinary 1MH is associated with white meat intake (p< 0.001), whereas urinary 3MH is associated with red meat intake (p< 0.001) (PMID: 34091671).",C7H11N3O2,169.1811,169.085126611,(2S)-2-amino-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)propanoic acid,1 methylhistidine,332-80-9,CN1C=NC(C[C@H](N)C(O)=O)=C1,"InChI=1S/C7H11N3O2/c1-10-3-5(9-4-10)2-6(8)7(11)12/h3-4,6H,2,8H2,1H3,(H,11,12)/t6-/m0/s1",BRMWTNUJHUMWMS-LURJTMIESA-N,Solid,83153.0,DB04151,FDB093588,92105.0,,50599.0,,C00052105,C01152,,,Methylhistidine,3741.0,,,"Jain, Rahul; Cohen, Louis A.

It is similar in chemical structure to uridine, but without the 2'-hydroxyl group. Deoxyuridine exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Within humans, deoxyuridine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, deoxyuridine can be biosynthesized from deoxycytidine through its interaction with the enzyme cytidine deaminase. In addition, deoxyuridine can be converted into uracil and deoxyribose 1-phosphate through its interaction with the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase. Deoxyuridine is considered to be an antimetabolite that is converted into deoxyuridine triphosphate during DNA synthesis. Laboratory suppression of deoxyuridine is used to diagnose megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies.

A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of alpha-ketoisovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465). alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

Biotin is also known as coenzyme R and vitamin H or B7. It occurs mainly bound to proteins or polypeptides and is abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, yeast, and milk. Biotin has been recognized as an essential nutrient. Humans fulfill their biotin requirement through their diet through endogenous reutilization of biotin and perhaps through the capture of biotin generated in the intestinal flora. The utilization of biotin for covalent attachment to carboxylases and its reutilization through the release of carboxylase biotin after proteolytic degradation constitutes the 'biotin cycle'. Biotin deficiency is associated with neurological manifestations, skin rash, hair loss, and metabolic disturbances that are thought to relate to the various carboxylase deficiencies (metabolic ketoacidosis with lactic acidosis). It has also been suggested that biotin deficiency is associated with protein malnutrition, and that marginal biotin deficiency in pregnant women may be teratogenic. Biotin acts as a carboxyl carrier in carboxylation reactions. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC), and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. Evidence is emerging that biotin participates in processes other than classical carboxylation reactions. Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signalling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signalling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signalling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to the effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signalling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology (PMID: 15992684, 16011464).",C10H16N2O3S,244.311,244.088163078,"5-[(3aS,4S,6aR)-2-oxo-hexahydro-1H-thieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl]pentanoic acid","5-[(3aS,4S,6aR)-2-oxo-hexahydrothieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl]pentanoic acid",58-85-5,[H][C@]12CS[C@@H](CCCCC(O)=O)[C@@]1([H])NC(=O)N2,"InChI=1S/C10H16N2O3S/c13-8(14)4-2-1-3-7-9-6(5-16-7)11-10(15)12-9/h6-7,9H,1-5H2,(H,13,14)(H2,11,12,15)/t6-,7-,9-/m0/s1",YBJHBAHKTGYVGT-ZKWXMUAHSA-N,Solid,149962.0,DB00121,FDB014510,171548.0,,15956.0,,C00000756,C00120,BIOTIN,33931.0,Biotin,243.0,BTN,,"Corey, E.

It is found exclusively in animal tissues and is naturally produced in the body by the liver. Carnosine has a pKa value of 6.83, making it a good buffer for the pH range of animal muscles.  Since beta-alanine is a non-proteogenic amino acid and is not incorporated into proteins, carnosine can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar) in muscles, with concentrations as high as 17‚Äì25 mmol/kg (dry muscle). Carnosine is also highly concentrated in brain tissues. Carnosine has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of fatty acids during oxidative stress. The antioxidant mechanism of carnosine is attributed to its chelating effect against divalent metal ions, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity, as well as its ROS and free radicals scavenging ability (PMID: 16406688). Carnosine also buffers muscle cells, and acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Carnosine has the potential to suppress many of the biochemical changes that accompany ageing (e.g. protein oxidation, glycation, AGE formation, and cross-linking) and associated pathologies (PMID: 16804013). Some autistic patients take carnosine as a dietary supplement and attribute an improvement in their condition to it. Supplemental carnosine may increase corticosterone levels. This may explain the ""hyperactivity"" seen in autistic subjects at higher doses. A positive association between muscle tissue carnosine concentration and exercise performance has been found. Œ≤-Alanine supplementation is thought increase exercise performance by promoting carnosine production in muscle. Exercise has conversely been found to increase muscle carnosine concentrations, and muscle carnosine content is higher in athletes engaging in anaerobic exercise. Carnosine is also a biomarker for the consumption of meat. Elevated levels of urinary and plasma carnosine are associated with carnosinuria (also known as carnosinemia), which is an inborn error of metabolism. caused by a deficiency of the enzyme carnosinase. Carnosinas cleaves carnosine into its constituent amino acids: Œ≤-Alanine and histidine. Carnonsinemia results in an excess of carnosine in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and nervous tissue.

It is a straight-chain alkyl carboxylic acid that appears as an oily, colorless liquid with an unpleasant (rancid butter) odor. The name butyric acid comes from the Greek word for ""butter"", the substance in which it was first found. Triglycerides of butyric acid constitute 3‚Äì4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, butyric acid is liberated from the short-chain triglycerides via hydrolysis. Butyric acid is a widely distributed SCFA and is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is present in animal fat and plant oils, bovine milk, breast milk, butter, parmesan cheese, body odor and vomit. While butyric acid has an unpleasant odor, it does have a pleasant buttery taste. As a result, butyric acid is used as a flavoring agent in food manufacturing. Low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as methyl butyrate, also have very pleasant aromas or tastes. As a result, several butyrate esters are used as food and perfume additives. Butyrate is naturally produced by fermentation processes performed by obligate anaerobic bacteria found in the mammalian gut. It is a metabolite of several bacterial genera including Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia (PMID: 12324374; PMID: 27446020). Highly-fermentable fiber residues, such as those from resistant starch, oat bran, pectin, and guar can be transformed by colonic bacteria into butyrate. One study found that resistant starch consistently produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fibre (PMID: 14747692). The production of butyrate from fibres in ruminant animals such as cattle is responsible for the butyrate content of milk and butter. Butyrate has a number of important biological functions and binds to several specific receptors. In humans, butyric acid is one of two primary endogenous agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a G protein-coupled receptor. Like other SCFAs, butyrate is also an agonist at the free fatty acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3, which function as nutrient sensors that facilitate the homeostatic control of energy balance. Butyrate is essential to host immune homeostasis (PMID: 25875123). Butyrate's effects on the immune system are mediated through the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (specifically, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8) and activation of its G-protein coupled receptor targets including HCA2, FFAR2 and FFAR3. Among the short-chain fatty acids, butyrate is the most potent promoter of intestinal regulatory T cells in vitro and the only SCFA that is an HCA2 ligand (PMID: 25741338). Butyrate has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. It possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. As a short-chain fatty acid, butyrate is metabolized by mitochondria as an energy source through fatty acid metabolism. In particular, it is an important energy source for cells lining the mammalian colon (colonocytes). Without butyrate, colon cells undergo autophagy (i.e., self-digestion) and die.",C4H8O2,88.1051,88.0524295,butanoic acid,butyric acid,107-92-6,CCCC(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C4H8O2/c1-2-3-4(5)6/h2-3H2,1H3,(H,5,6)",FERIUCNNQQJTOY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Liquid,259.0,DB03568,FDB031031,264.0,,30772.0,,C00001180,C00246,BUTYRIC_ACID,34376.0,Butyric_acid,107.0,BUT,,"Shan, Zhiping.

Adenosine or adenosine derivatives play many important biological roles in addition to being components of DNA and RNA. For instance, adenosine plays an important role in energy transfer as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). It also plays a role in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Adenosine itself is both a neurotransmitter and potent vasodilator. When administered intravenously adenosine causes transient heart block in the AV node. Due to the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent supraventricular tachycardia, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. Overdoses of adenosine intake (as a drug) can lead to several side effects including chest pain, feeling faint, shortness of breath, and tingling of the senses. Serious side effects include a worsening dysrhythmia and low blood pressure. When present in sufficiently high levels, adenosine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of adenosine are associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency. Adenosine is a precursor to deoxyadenosine, which is a precursor to dATP.

Carnitine is also classified as an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Carnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers D-carnitine and L-carnitine. Both are biologically active, but only L-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and D-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the L-form. Carnitine is involved in the metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria.  Carnitine plays a key role in lipid metabolism and beta-oxidation. It is used to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria to be oxidized for energy production. This is done by forming a long chain acetylcarnitine esters which are then transported by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II. Carnitine also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in skeletal and cardiac muscle as well as other tissues that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. A normal 70 kilogram person typically produces 11‚Äì34 mg of carnitine per day. Adults eating mixed diets of red meat and other animal products ingest 60‚Äì180 mg of carnitine per day, while vegans consume about 10‚Äì12 mg per day. Most carnitine obtained from the diet is absorbed in the small intestine before entering the blood.[3] The total body content of carnitine is about 20 grams in a person weighing 70 kilograms, with nearly all of it contained within skeletal muscle cells. Carnitine is so important in providing energy to muscles (including the heart) that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat (the main food source for carnitine). Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin (i.e. an essential metabolite). Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water. However, most animals, including humans, make their own carnitine; thus, carnitine cannot be considered to be a vitamin. In certain circumstances, such as methionine deficiency, lysine deficiency, vitamin C deficiency or kidney dialysis, carnitine shortages can develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as a ""metabimin"" or a conditionally essential metabolite. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney, and brain from lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism such as Reye‚Äôs syndrome can lead to brain deterioration gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy, and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Carnitine is an essential nutrient for pre-term babies and individuals who are unable to eat a normal diet (e.g. non-ketotic hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients) (PMID: 115309). In conditions such as kwashiorkor, cirrhosis, and heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy) as well as in inborn errors of metabolism such as type IV hyperlipidemia and propionic aciduria, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are critically important. Carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. Carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. Carnitine supplements may also be useful in many forms of metabolic liver diseases and heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. Carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. Carnitine may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to the low motility of sperm. Carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia. Carnitine is a biomarker for the consumption of meat. In fact, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, ""caro/carnis"" or flesh.",C7H16NO3,162.2068,162.113018383,(3R)-3-hydroxy-4-(trimethylazaniumyl)butanoate,L-carnitine,541-15-1,C[N+](C)(C)C[C@H](O)CC(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C7H15NO3/c1-8(2,3)5-6(9)4-7(10)11/h6,9H,4-5H2,1-3H3/p+1/t6-/m1/s1",PHIQHXFUZVPYII-ZCFIWIBFSA-O,Solid,2006614.0,DB00583,FDB000571,10917.0,,16347.0,,,C00318,CARNITINE,34600.0,Carnitine,52.0,CRN,," Bols, Mikael; Lundt, Inge; Pedersen, Christian.

Creatine is found in all vertebrates where it facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Its primary metabolic role is to combine with a phosphoryl group, via the enzyme creatine kinase, to generate phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate ATP. Most of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle (95%), while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, testes, and other tissues. Creatine is not an essential nutrient as it is naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine, with an additional requirement for methionine to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine.

Dopamine is synthesized in the body (mainly by nervous tissue and adrenal glands) first by the hydration of the amino acid tyrosine to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase and then by the decarboxylation of DOPA by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (dopamine receptors) mediates its action, which plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Dopamine has many other functions outside the brain. In blood vessels, dopamine inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists, which reduce dopamine activity. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and addiction are also characterized by defects in dopamine production or metabolism. It has been suggested that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time. This is perhaps a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria. Dopamine is elevated in the urine of people who consume bananas. When present in sufficiently high levels, dopamine can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of dopamine are associated with neuroblastoma, Costello syndrome, leukemia, phaeochromocytoma, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, and Menkes disease (MNK). High levels of dopamine can lead to hyperactivity, insomnia, agitation and anxiety, depression, delusions, excessive salivation, nausea, and digestive problems.

Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (dopamine receptors) mediates its action, which plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Dopamine has many other functions outside the brain. In blood vessels, dopamine inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists, which reduce dopamine activity. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and addiction are also characterized by defects in dopamine production or metabolism. It has been suggested that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time. This is perhaps a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria. Dopamine is elevated in the urine of people who consume bananas. When present in sufficiently high levels, dopamine can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of dopamine are associated with neuroblastoma, Costello syndrome, leukemia, phaeochromocytoma, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, and Menkes disease (MNK). High levels of dopamine can lead to hyperactivity, insomnia, agitation and anxiety, depression, delusions, excessive salivation, nausea, and digestive problems.

Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. Dihydrouracil is an intermediate breakdown product of uracil. Dihydrouracil exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, dihydrouracil participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, dihydrouracil can be biosynthesized from uracil; which is mediated by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]. The breakdown of uracil is a multistep reaction that leads to the production of beta-alanine. The reaction process begins with the enzyme known as dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHP), which catalyzes the reduction of uracil into dihydrouracil. Then the enzyme known as dihydropyrimidinase hydrolyzes dihydrouracil into N-carbamyl-beta-alanine. Finally, beta-ureidopropionase catalyzes the conversion of N-carbamyl-beta-alanine into beta-alanine. There is at least one metabolic disorder that is associated with altered levels of dihydrouracil. In particular, dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is an inborn metabolic disorder that leads to highly increased concentrations of dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine, and moderately increased concentrations of uracil and thymine in urine. Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency can cause neurological and gastrointestinal problems in some affected individuals (OMIM: 222748). In particular, patients with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency exhibit a number of neurological abnormalities including intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), an abnormally small head size (microcephaly), and autistic behaviours that affect communication and social interaction. Gastrointestinal problems that occur in dihydropyrimidinase deficiency include backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) and recurrent episodes of vomiting.",C4H6N2O2,114.1026,114.042927446,"1,3-diazinane-2,4-dione",dihydrouracil,504-07-4,O=C1CCNC(=O)N1,"InChI=1S/C4H6N2O2/c7-3-1-2-5-4(8)6-3/h1-2H2,(H2,5,6,7,8)",OIVLITBTBDPEFK-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,629.0,DB01849,FDB030556,649.0,,15901.0,,,C00429,DI-H-URACIL,34956.0,Dihydrouracil,285.0,56DURA,,"Bhat, K.

Deoxyguanosine is a nucleoside consisting of the base guanine and the sugar deoxyribose. Deoxyguanosine is one of the four deoxyribonucleosides that make up DNA. Deoxyguanosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Deoxyguanosine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, deoxyguanosine can be biosynthesized from 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate through the enzyme known as cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase. In addition, deoxyguanosine can be converted into 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP); which is mediated by the enzyme deoxyguanosine kinase. Deoxyguanosine is involved in the rare, inherited metabolic disorder called the purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency (PNP deficiency). In particular PNP deficiency is characterized by elevated levels of dGTP (deoxyguanosine triphosphate). PNP accounts for approximately 4% of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (PMID: 1931007).

Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle, the Citric Acid cycle or Krebs cycle). The TCA cycle is a central metabolic pathway for all animals, plants, and bacteria. As a result, citrate is found in all living organisms, from bacteria to plants to animals. In the TCA cycle, the enzyme citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for the enzyme known as aconitase and is then converted into aconitic acid. The TCA cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions in the TCA cycle is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. Citrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl CoA, which is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate. In mammals and other vertebrates, Citrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of apatite crystals (PMID: 21127269). Citric acid is found in citrus fruits, most concentrated in lemons and limes, where it can comprise as much as 8% of the dry weight of the fruit. Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and carbonated drinks. Because it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Citric acid is an excellent chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It can be used to treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. The salts of citric acid (citrates) can be used as anticoagulants due to their calcium chelating ability. Intolerance to citric acid in the diet is known to exist.

It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside cytidine. CMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase cytosine. Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is derived from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) with subsequent loss of two phosphates. The synthesis of the pyrimidines CTP and UTP occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and CO2. Next, aspartate undergoes a condensation reaction with carbamoyl-phosphate to form orotic acid. In a subsequent cyclization reaction, the enzyme Aspartate carbamoyltransferase forms N-carbamoyl-aspartate which is converted into dihydroorotic acid by Dihydroorotase. The latter is converted to orotate by Dihydroorotate oxidase. Orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit with Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (aka ""PRPP transferase"") catalyzing reaction, yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP). Orotidine-5-phosphate is decarboxylated by Orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate (UMP). UMP is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate (UTP) via two sequential reactions with ATP. CTP is subsequently formed by amination of UTP by the catalytic activity of CTP synthetase. Cytosine monophosphate (CMP) and uridine monophosphate (UMP) have been prescribed for the treatment of neuromuscular affections in humans. Patients treated with CMP/UMP recover from altered neurological functions. Additionally, the administration of CMP/UMP appears to favour the entry of glucose in the muscle and CMP/UMP may be important in maintaining the level of hepatic glycogen constant during exercise.

It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system. Ethanol is a general biomarker for the consumption of alcohol. Ethanol is also a metabolite of Hansenula and Saccharomyces (PMID: 14613880) (https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0079635206800470/1-s2.0-S0079635206800470-main.pdf?_tid=4d340044-3230-4141-88dd-deec4d2e35bd&acdnat=1550288012_0c4a20fe963843426147979d376cf624).",C2H6O,46.0684,46.041864814,ethanol,ethyl alcohol,64-17-5,CCO,"InChI=1S/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3",LFQSCWFLJHTTHZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Liquid,682.0,DB00898,FDB000753,702.0,,16236.0,,C00019560,C00469,ETOH,35062.0,Ethanol,3203.0,ETOH,,"Lashley, David.

It is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. In vertebrates, GABA acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain. It acts by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow either the flow of negatively-charged chloride ions into the cell or positively-charged potassium ions out of the cell. This will typically result in a negative change in the transmembrane potential, usually causing hyperpolarization. Three general classes of GABA receptor are known (PMID: 10561820). These include GABA-A and GABA-C ionotropic receptors, which are ion channels themselves, and GABA-B metabotropic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that open ion channels via intermediaries known as G proteins (PMID: 10561820). Activation of the GABA-B receptor by GABA causes neuronal membrane hyperpolarization and a resultant inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In addition to binding sites for GABA, the GABA-A receptor has binding sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteroids. GABA-A receptors are coupled to chloride ion channels. Therefore, activation of the GABA-A receptor induces increased inward chloride ion flux, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition (PMID: 10561820). After release into the synapse, free GABA that does not bind to either the GABA-A or GABA-B receptor complexes can be taken up by neurons and glial cells. Four different GABA membrane transporter proteins (GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1), which differ in their distribution in the CNS, are believed to mediate the uptake of synaptic GABA into neurons and glial cells. The GABA-A receptor subtype regulates neuronal excitability and rapid changes in fear arousal, such as anxiety, panic, and the acute stress response (PMID: 10561820). Drugs that stimulate GABA-A receptors, such as the benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have anxiolytic and anti-seizure effects via GABA-A-mediated reduction of neuronal excitability, which effectively raises the seizure threshold. GABA-A antagonists produce convulsions in animals and there is decreased GABA-A receptor binding in a positron emission tomography (PET) study of patients with panic disorder. Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the vertebrate. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are a typical example of inhibitory CNS GABAergic cells. GABA has been shown to have excitatory roles in the vertebrate, most notably in the developing cortex. Organisms synthesize GABA from glutamate using the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase and pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor (PMID: 12467378). It is worth noting that this involves converting the principal excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate) into the principal inhibitory one (GABA). Drugs that act as agonists of GABA receptors (known as GABA analogs or GABAergic drugs), or increase the available amount of GABA typically have relaxing, anti-anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects. GABA is found to be deficient in cerebrospinal fluid and the brain in many studies of experimental and human epilepsy. Benzodiazepines (such as Valium) are useful in status epilepticus because they act on GABA receptors. GABA increases in the brain after administration of many seizure medications. Hence, GABA is clearly an antiepileptic nutrient. Inhibitors of GAM metabolism can also produce convulsions. Spasticity and involuntary movement syndromes, such as Parkinson's, Friedreich's ataxia, tardive dyskinesia, and Huntington's chorea, are all marked by low GABA when amino acid levels are studied. Trials of 2 to 3 g of GABA given orally have been effective in various epilepsy and spasticity syndromes. Agents that elevate GABA are also useful in lowering hypertension. Three grams orally have been effective in controlling blood pressure. GABA is decreased in various encephalopathies. GABA can reduce appetite and is decreased in hypoglycemics. GABA reduces blood sugar in diabetics. Chronic brain syndromes can also be marked by deficiencies of GABA. Vitamin B6, manganese, taurine, and lysine can increase both GABA synthesis and effects, while aspartic acid and glutamic acid probably inhibit GABA effects. Low plasma GABA has been reported in some depressed patients and may be a useful trait marker for mood disorders. GABA has an important role in embryonic development, especially facial development, as substantiated by the association of a cleft palate in transgenic mice deficient in GAD67 (glutamate decarboxylase). A recent Japanese population study reported linkage in patients with a nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and specific GAD67 haplotypes (PMID: 23842532). Unusually high levels of GABA (especially in the brain) can be toxic and GABA can function as both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that damages the brain and/or nerve tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of GABA are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria/succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, GABA-transaminase deficiency, homocarnosinosis, and hyper beta-alaninemia. Nearly all of these conditions are associated with seizures, hypotonia, intellectual deficits, macrocephaly, encephalopathy, and other serious neurological or neuromuscular problems. Increased levels of GABA seem to alter the function of the GABA-B receptor, which may play a role in the tonic-clonic seizures that are often seen in patients with the above disorders. GABA is also a microbial metabolite, urinary GABA is produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (PMID: 24621061).",C4H9NO2,103.1198,103.063328537,4-aminobutanoic acid,gamma(amino)-butyric acid,56-12-2,NCCCC(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C4H9NO2/c5-3-1-2-4(6)7/h1-3,5H2,(H,6,7)",BTCSSZJGUNDROE-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,116.0,DB02530,FDB030489,119.0,,16865.0,,C00001337,C00334,4-AMINO-BUTYRATE,34652.0,Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid,,4ABUT,,"Minoshima, Ryoichi.

This colourless, odourless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. Due to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid is often used in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the outer skin to dissolve, revealing the underlying skin. It is thought that this is due to the reduction of calcium ion concentrations in the epidermis and the removal of calcium ions from cell adhesions, leading to desquamation. Glycolic acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase. This can suppress melanin formation and lead to a lightening of skin colour. Acute doses of glycolic acid on skin or eyes leads to local effects that are typical of a strong acid (e.g. dermal and eye irritation). Glycolate is a nephrotoxin if consumed orally. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. Glycolic acid's renal toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acid, along with excess lactic acid, are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. Glycolic acid does exhibit some inhalation toxicity and can cause respiratory, thymus, and liver damage if present in very high levels over long periods of time. Elevated glycolic acid without elevated oxalic acid is most likely a result of GI yeast overgrowth (Aspergillus, Penicillium, probably Candida) or due to dietary sources containing glycerol (glycerine).

Methoxyphenols are compounds containing a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring of a phenol moiety. HVA is also classified as a catechol.  HVA is a major catecholamine metabolite that is produced by a consecutive action of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase on dopamine. HVA is typically elevated in patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors (such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and other neural crest tumors). HVA levels are also used in monitoring patients who have been treated for these kinds tumors. HVA levels may also be altered in disorders of catecholamine metabolism such as monoamine oxidase-A (MOA) deficiency. MOA deficiency can cause decreased urinary HVA values, while a deficiency of dopamine beta-hydrolase (the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine) can cause elevated urinary HVA values. Within humans, HVA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, HVA and pyrocatechol can be biosynthesized from 3,4-dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid and guaiacol. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme known as catechol O-methyltransferase. In addition, HVA can be biosynthesized from homovanillin through the action of the enzyme known aldehyde dehydrogenase. HVA has recently been found in a number of beers and appears to arise from the fermentation process (https://doi.org/10.1006/fstl.1999.0593). HVA is also a metabolite of Bifidobacterium (PMID: 24958563) and the bacterial breakdown of dietary flavonoids. Dietary flavonols commonly found in tomatoes, onions, and tea, can lead to significantly elevated levels of urinary HVA (PMID: 20933512). Likewise, the microbial digestion of hydroxytyrosol (found in olive oil) can also lead to elevated levels of HVA in humans (PMID: 11929304).",C9H10O4,182.1733,182.057908808,2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid,homovanillic acid,306-08-1,COC1=C(O)C=CC(CC(O)=O)=C1,"InChI=1S/C9H10O4/c1-13-8-4-6(5-9(11)12)2-3-7(8)10/h2-4,10H,5H2,1H3,(H,11,12)",QRMZSPFSDQBLIX-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,1675.0,,FDB001783,1738.0,,545959.0,574.0,C00029504,C05582,CPD-7651,46066.0,Homovanillic_acid,971.0,HOMOVAL,,,HMDB0000118

Glyoxylic acid is a liquid with a melting point of -93°C and a boiling point of 111°C. It is an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle, which enables certain organisms to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate (PMID: 16396466). In humans, glyoxylate is produced via two pathways: (1) through the oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes and (2) through the catabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria. In the peroxisomes, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT1) or into oxalate by glycolate oxidase. In the mitochondria, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by mitochondrial glyoxylate aminotransferase AGT2 or into glycolate by glycolate reductase. A small amount of glyoxylate is converted into oxalate by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase. Glyoxylic acid is found to be associated with primary hyperoxaluria I, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Under certain circumstances, glyoxylate can be a nephrotoxin and a metabotoxin. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. High levels of glyoxylate are involved in the development of hyperoxaluria, a key cause of nephrolithiasis (commonly known as kidney stones). Glyoxylate is both a substrate and inductor of sulfate anion transporter-1 (SAT-1), a gene responsible for oxalate transportation, allowing it to increase SAT-1 mRNA expression, and as a result oxalate efflux from the cell. The increased oxalate release allows the buildup of calcium oxalate in the urine, and thus the eventual formation of kidney stones. As an aldehyde, glyoxylate is also highly reactive and will modify proteins to form advanced glycation products (AGEs).",C2H2O3,74.0355,74.00039393,2-oxoacetic acid,glyoxylic acid,298-12-4,OC(=O)C=O,"InChI=1S/C2H2O3/c3-1-2(4)5/h1H,(H,4,5)",HHLFWLYXYJOTON-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Liquid,740.0,DB04343,FDB007244,760.0,,16891.0,,C00001186,C00048,GLYOX,33659.0,Glyoxylic_acid,3213.0,GLX,,"Jie, Yuanping; Song, Zhen.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Glycine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glycine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid and is the simplest of all amino acids. In humans, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult human ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. The name comes from the Greek word glucus or ""sweet tasting"". Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved glycine metabolism is called the glycine cleavage system. The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio (PMID: 16151895). Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM: 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10, and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T-, and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM: 238300), AMT (OMIM: 238310), and GCSH (OMIM: 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, hemoglobin, and collagen, and in the release of energy. The principal function of glycine is as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine. In higher eukaryotes, delta-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins (needed for hemoglobin and cytochromes), is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Glycine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glycine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid and is the simplest of all amino acids. In humans, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult human ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. The name comes from the Greek word glucus or ""sweet tasting"". Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved glycine metabolism is called the glycine cleavage system. The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio (PMID: 16151895). Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM: 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10, and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T-, and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM: 238300), AMT (OMIM: 238310), and GCSH (OMIM: 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, hemoglobin, and collagen, and in the release of energy. The principal function of glycine is as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine. In higher eukaryotes, delta-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins (needed for hemoglobin and cytochromes), is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase. Glycine provides the central C2N subunit of all purines, which are key constituents of DNA and RNA.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof. Guanidinoacetic acid was first prepared in 1861 by Adolph Strecker by reaction of cyanamide with glycine in aqueous solution. Manufactured guanidinoacetic acid is primarily used a feed additive approved by EFSA in poultry farming (for fattening), and pigs for fattening. Guanidoacetic acid exists naturally in all vertebrates. It is formed primarily in the kidneys by transferring the guanidine group of L-arginine to the amino acid glycine via the enzyme known as L-Arg:Gly-amidinotransferase (AGAT). In a further step, guanidinoacetate is methylated to generate creatine using S-adenosyl methionine (as the methyl donor) via the enzyme known as guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT). The resulting creatine is released into the bloodstream. Elevated levels of guanidoacetic acid are a characteristic of an inborn metabolic disorder known as Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase (GAMT) Deficiency. GAMT converts guanidinoacetate to creatine and deficiency of this enzyme results in creatine depletion and accumulation of guanidinoacetate The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion and is localized to mutations on chromosome 19p13.3. GAMT deficiency is characterized by developmental arrest, medication-resistant epilepsy (myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, partial complex, atonic), severe speech impairment, progressive dystonia, dyskinesias, hypotonia, ataxia, and autistic-like behavior.

It is generated from the compound p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate through the enzyme p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dehydrogenase. The resulting homogentisic acid is then broken down into 4-maleylacetoacetate via the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. Homogentisic acid is also found in other organisms. For instance, it can found in Arbutus unedo (strawberry-tree) honey, in the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris as well as in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica where it is associated with the production of brown pigments. Homogentisic acid can be oxidatively dimerized to form hipposudoric acid, one of the main constituents of the 'blood sweat' of hippopotamuses. When present in sufficiently high levels, homogentisic acid can function as an osteotoxin and a renal toxin. An osteotoxin is a substance that causes damage to bones and/or joints. A renal toxin causes damage to the kidneys. Chronically high levels of homogentisic acid are associated with alkaptonuria (OMIM: 203500), an inborn error of metabolism. Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited genetic disorder in which the body cannot process the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is caused by a mutation in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5), which leads to an accumulation of homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form benzoquinone acetic acid are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid (and benzoquinone acetic acid) causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. More specifically, homogentisic acid can be converted to benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA), and the resulting BQA can be readily converted to polymers that resemble the dark skin pigment melanin. These polymers are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.

Guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine. The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 from the excreta of sea birds, known as guano, which was used as a source of fertilizer. High affinity binding of guanine nucleotides and the ability to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP are characteristics of an extended family of intracellular proteins. Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins may be involved in the activation of phospholipases C and A2 by hormones and other ligands. The binding of hormones to receptors that activate phospholipase C is decreased by guanine nucleotides and these hormones also stimulate a high-affinity GTPase activity in cell membranes. Effects of hormones on phospholipase C activity in cell-free preparations are dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to their respective mononucleotides. Partial deficiency of this enzyme can result in the overproduction of uric acid leading to a severe form of gout, whilst a virtual absence of HPRT activity causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an inborn error of metabolism, which is characterised by hyperuricaemia, mental retardation, choreoathetosis and compulsive self-mutilation.

Purine nucleosides are compounds comprising a purine base attached to a ribosyl or deoxyribosyl sugar moiety. Guanosine consists of a guanine base attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a beta-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine is a white, crystalline powder with no odor and mild saline taste. It is very soluble in acetic acid, and slightly soluble in water, but insoluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, benzene, and chloroform. Guanosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. High levels of guanosine can be found in clovers, coffee plants, and the pollen of pines. It has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as leeks, garlic, chicory roots, green bell peppers, and black-eyed peas. Guanosine plays an important role in various biochemical processes including the synthesis of nucleic acids such as RNA and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP). The antiviral drug acyclovir, often used in herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug abacavir, are both structurally similar to guanosine. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In humans, guanosine is involved in intracellular signalling through the adenosine receptors A1R and A2AR (PMID: 31847113). Evidence from rodent and cell models has shown a number of important neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of guanosine. In particular, it is effective in preventing deleterious consequences of seizures, spinal cord injury, pain, mood disorders and aging-related diseases, such as ischemia, Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs diseases (PMID: 27699087). Studies with rodent models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease have shown that guanosine decreases neuronal apoptotic cell death and increases dopaminergic neurons at substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by an improvement of motor symptoms in Parkinson‚Äôs disease (i.e. a reduction of bradykinesia).

High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation.

It takes part in the metabolism of one-carbon compounds and its carbon may appear in methyl groups undergoing transmethylation. It is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. Formate is typically produced as a byproduct in the production of acetate. It is responsible for both metabolic acidosis and disrupting mitochondrial electron transport and energy production by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase activity, the terminal electron acceptor of the electron transport chain. Cell death from cytochrome oxidase inhibition by formate is believed to result partly from depletion of ATP, reducing energy concentrations so that essential cell functions cannot be maintained. Furthermore, inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by formate may also cause cell death by increased production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) secondary to the blockade of the electron transport chain. In nature, formic acid is found in the stings and bites of many insects of the order Hymenoptera, including bees and ants.

Apples contain malic acid, which contributes to the sourness of a green apple. Malic acid can make a wine taste tart, although the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness (Wikipedia). In its ionized form, malic acid is called malate. Malate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle along with fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate as one of the anaplerotic reactions. In humans, malic acid is both derived from food sources and synthesized in the body through the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle which takes place in the mitochondria. Malate's importance to the production of energy in the body during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well established. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate provides reducing equivalents to the mitochondria through the malate-aspartate redox shuttle. During anaerobic conditions, where a buildup of excess reducing equivalents inhibits glycolysis, malic acid's simultaneous reduction to succinate and oxidation to oxaloacetate is capable of removing the accumulating reducing equivalents. This allows malic acid to reverse hypoxia's inhibition of glycolysis and energy production. In studies on rats, it has been found that only tissue malate is depleted following exhaustive physical activity. Other key metabolites from the citric acid cycle needed for energy production were found to be unchanged. Because of this, a deficiency of malic acid has been hypothesized to be a major cause of physical exhaustion. Notably, the administration of malic acid to rats has been shown to elevate mitochondrial malate and increase mitochondrial respiration and energy production. Malic acid has been found to be a metabolite in Aspergillus (Hugo Vanden Bossche, D.W.R. Mackenzie and G. Cauwenbergh.

Purines are a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. Hypoxanthine is also classified as an oxopurine, Hypoxanthine is a naturally occurring purine derivative and a reaction intermediate in the metabolism of adenosine and in the formation of nucleic acids by the nucleotide salvage pathway. Hypoxanthine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Hypoxanthine has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as radish (var.), mountain yams, welsh onions, greenthread tea, and common beets. Hypoxanthine is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. Biologically, hypoxanthine can be formed a number of ways. For instance, it is one of the products of the action of xanthine oxidase on xanthine. However, more frequently xanthine is formed from oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. The enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase converts hypoxanthine into IMP in the nucleotide salvage pathway. Hypoxanthine is also a spontaneous deamination product of adenine. Under normal circumstances hypoxanthine is readily converted to uric acid. In this process, hypoxanthine is first oxidized to xanthine, which is further oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase. Molecular oxygen, the oxidant in both reactions, is reduced to H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species. In humans, uric acid is the final product of purine degradation and is excreted in the urine. Within humans, hypoxanthine participates in a number of other enzymatic reactions. In particular, hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from inosine through its interaction with the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Hypoxanthine is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a disorder of the immune system (primary immunodeficiency) characterized by recurrent infections, neurologic symptoms, and autoimmune disorders. PNP deficiency causes a shortage of white blood cells, called T-cells, that help fight infection.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-tyrosine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tyrosine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aromatic amino acid.  Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning the body can synthesize it ‚Äì usually from phenylalanine. The conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. Tyrosine is found in many high-protein food products such as chicken, turkey, fish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy products, lima beans, avocados and bananas. Tyrosine is one of the few amino acids that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, including thyroid hormones (diiodotyrosine), catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism have been identified, such as hawkinsinuria and tyrosinemia I. The most common feature of these diseases is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements can help reverse these disease symptoms. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This typically indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can help aleviate biochemical depression. However, tyrosine may not be good for treating psychosis. Many antipsychotic medications apparently function by inhibiting tyrosine metabolism. L-Dopa, which is directly used in Parkinson's, is made from tyrosine. Tyrosine, the nutrient, can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's. Peripheral metabolism of tyrosine necessitates large doses of tyrosine, however, compared to L-Dopa (http://www.dcnutrition.com). In addition to its role as a precursor for neurotransmitters, tyrosine plays an important role for the function of many proteins.  Within many proteins or enzymes, certain tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by specialized protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity.  Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is also needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10.",C9H11NO3,181.1885,181.073893223,(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid,L-tyrosine,60-18-4,N[C@@H](CC1=CC=C(O)C=C1)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C9H11NO3/c10-8(9(12)13)5-6-1-3-7(11)4-2-6/h1-4,8,11H,5,10H2,(H,12,13)/t8-/m0/s1",OUYCCCASQSFEME-QMMMGPOBSA-N,Solid,5833.0,DB00135,FDB000446,6057.0,,17895.0,,C00001397,C00082,TYR,33785.0,Tyrosine,34.0,TYR_L,,"Enei, Hitoshi; Matsui, Hiroshi; Yamashita, Koichi; Okumura, Shinji; Yamada, Hideaki.

L-phenylalanine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Phenylalanine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aromatic, non-polar amino acid. In humans, phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and the precursor of the amino acid tyrosine. Like tyrosine, phenylalanine is also a precursor for catecholamines including tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are neurotransmitters that act as adrenalin-like substances. Interestingly, several psychotropic drugs (mescaline, morphine, codeine, and papaverine) also have phenylalanine as a constituent. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in the human brain and plasma. Normal metabolism of phenylalanine requires biopterin, iron, niacin, vitamin B6, copper, and vitamin C. An average adult ingests 5 g of phenylalanine per day and may optimally need up to 8 g daily. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in a number of high protein foods, such as meat, cottage cheese, and wheat germ. An additional dietary source of phenylalanine is artificial sweeteners containing aspartame (a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide). As a general rule, aspartame should be avoided by phenylketonurics and pregnant women. When present in sufficiently high levels, phenylalanine can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of phenylalanine are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including Hartnup disorder, hyperphenylalaninemia due to guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase deficiency, phenylketonuria (PKU), tyrosinemia type 2 (or Richner-Hanhart syndrome), and tyrosinemia type III (TYRO3). Phenylketonurics have elevated serum plasma levels of phenylalanine up to 400 times normal. High plasma concentrations of phenylalanine influence the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids. The high plasma phenylalanine concentrations increase phenylalanine entry into the brain and restrict the entry of other large neutral amino acids (PMID: 19191004). Phenylalanine has been found to interfere with different cerebral enzyme systems. Untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioural problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Classic PKU dramatically affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological disorders associated with phenylketonuria. Mild phenylketonuria can act as an unsuspected cause of hyperactivity, learning problems, and other developmental problems in children. It has been recently suggested that PKU may resemble amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, due to the formation of toxic amyloid-like assemblies of phenylalanine (PMID: 22706200). Phenylalanine also has some potential benefits. Phenylalanine can act as an effective pain reliever. Its use in premenstrual syndrome and Parkinson's may enhance the effects of acupuncture and electric transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Phenylalanine and tyrosine, like L-DOPA, produce a catecholamine-like effect. Phenylalanine is better absorbed than tyrosine and may cause fewer headaches. Low phenylalanine diets have been prescribed for certain cancers with mixed results.

L-alanine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Alanine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid. In humans, alanine is a non-essential amino acid that can be easily made in the body from either the conversion of pyruvate or the breakdown of the dipeptides carnosine and anserine. Alanine can be also synthesized from branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Alanine is produced by reductive amination of pyruvate through a two-step process. In the first step, alpha-ketoglutarate, ammonia and NADH are converted by the enzyme known glutamate dehydrogenase to glutamate, NAD+ and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly-formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an aminotransferase enzyme, regenerating the alpha-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine. In mammals, alanine plays a key role in glucose‚Äìalanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, through the action of alanine aminotransferase, forming alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The alanine enters the bloodstream and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in gluconeogenesis, forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Alanine is highly concentrated in muscle and is one of the most important amino acids released by muscle, functioning as a major energy source. Plasma alanine is often decreased when the BCAA (branched-chain amino acids) are deficient. This finding may relate to muscle metabolism. Alanine is highly concentrated in meat products and other high-protein foods like wheat germ and cottage cheese. Alanine is an important participant as well as a regulator of glucose metabolism. Alanine levels parallel blood sugar levels in both diabetes and hypoglycemia, and alanine is reduced in both severe hypoglycemia and the ketosis of diabetes. Alanine is an important amino acid for lymphocyte reproduction and immunity. Alanine therapy has helped dissolve kidney stones in experimental animals. Normal alanine metabolism, like that of other amino acids, is highly dependent upon enzymes that contain vitamin B6.

Studies in rats have shown that when injected into the brain, proline non-selectively destroys pyramidal and granule cells (PMID: 3409032 ). Therefore, under certain conditions proline can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of proline are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including hyperprolinemia type I, hyperprolinemia type II, iminoglycinuria, prolinemia type II, and pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. People with hyperprolinemia type I often do not show any symptoms even though they have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Some individuals with hyperprolinemia type I exhibit seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological or psychiatric problems. Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15 times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Hyperprolinemia type II has signs and symptoms that vary in severity and is more likely than type I to involve seizures or intellectual disability.",C5H9NO2,115.1305,115.063328537,(2S)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid,L-proline,147-85-3,OC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1,"InChI=1S/C5H9NO2/c7-5(8)4-2-1-3-6-4/h4,6H,1-3H2,(H,7,8)/t4-/m0/s1",ONIBWKKTOPOVIA-BYPYZUCNSA-N,Solid,128566.0,DB00172,FDB000570,145742.0,,17203.0,,C00001388,C00148,PRO,34042.0,L-proline,29.0,PRO_L,," Itoh, Tamio.

Inosinic acid exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. IMP is widely used as a flavor enhancer. In the food industry it is known as E number reference E630.  Inosinic acid can be converted into various salts including disodium inosinate (E631), dipotassium inosinate (E632), and calcium inosinate (E633). These three inosinate compounds are used as flavor enhancers for the basic taste umami. These inosinate salts are mostly used in soups, sauces, and seasonings for the intensification and balance of the flavor of meat. Inosinic acid is typically obtained from chicken byproducts or other meat industry waste. Inosinic acid or IMP is important in metabolism. It is the ribonucleotide of hypoxanthine and the first nucleotide formed during the synthesis of purine nucleotides. It can also be formed by the deamination of adenosine monophosphate by AMP deaminase.  GMP is formed by the inosinate oxidation to xanthylate (XMP).

It consists of an ethylene group flanked by two carboxylic acid groups. Maleic acid is the cis isomer of butenedioic acid, whereas fumaric acid is the trans isomer. The cis isomer is the less stable one of the two; the difference in heat of combustion is 22.7 kJ/mol. The physical properties of maleic acid are very different from that of fumaric acid. Maleic acid is soluble in water whereas fumaric acid is not and the melting point of maleic acid (130 - 131 oC) is also much lower than that of fumaric acid (287 oC). Maleic acid is converted into maleic anhydride by dehydration, to malic acid by hydration, and to succinic acid by hydrogenation. Maleic acid is used in making polyesters for fibre-reinforced laminated moldings and paint vehicles. More specifically it is used in the manufacture of phthalic-type alkyd and polyester resins, surface coatings, copolymers, plasticizers, lubricant additives and agricultural chemicals. It is also found in adhesives and sealants and as a preservative for oils and fats. In the natural world, maleic acid has been identified in ginseng, pineapple, cacao plants, sour cherries and corn. A large number of microbes are able to convert maleic acid to D-malate using the enzyme maleate hydratase (PMID: 1444397).",C4H4O4,116.0722,116.010958616,(2Z)-but-2-enedioic acid,maleic acid,110-16-7,OC(=O)\C=C/C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C4H4O4/c5-3(6)1-2-4(7)8/h1-2H,(H,5,6)(H,7,8)/b2-1-",VZCYOOQTPOCHFL-UPHRSURJSA-N,Solid,392248.0,DB04299,FDB008113,444266.0,,18300.0,,C00007417,C01384,MALEATE,,Maleic_acid,,,,"Dethloff, Christian; Barbarino, Sergio.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Histidine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Histidine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, positively charged or basic amino acid. Histidine is a unique amino acid with an imidazole functional group. The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes such as proteases. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel in 1896. Histidine is an essential amino acid in humans and other mammals. It was initially thought that it was only essential for infants, but longer-term studies established that it is also essential for adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Histidine is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism, including histidinemia, maple syrup urine disease, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory properties (PMID: 9605177 ). The efficacy of L-histidine in protecting inflamed tissue is attributed to the capacity of the imidazole ring to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by cells during acute inflammatory response (PMID: 9605177 ). Histidine, when administered in therapeutic quantities is able to inhibit cytokines and growth factors involved in cell and tissue damage (US patent 6150392). Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of very rapid removal of histidine from their blood (PMID: 1079527 ). Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Urinary levels of histidine are reduced in pediatric patients with pneumonia (PMID: 2084459 ). Asthma patients exhibit increased serum levels of histidine over normal controls (PMID: 23517038 ). Serum histidine levels are lower and are negatively associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women (PMID: 23361591 ). Histidine supplementation has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce BMI and fat mass and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with metabolic syndrome. Histidine appears to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly via the NF-Œ∫B pathway, in adipocytes (PMID: 23361591 ). Low plasma concentrations of histidine are associated with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, and greater mortality in chronic kidney disease patients (PMID: 18541578 ). Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  L-DOPA is found naturally in both animals and plants. It is made via biosynthesis from the amino acid L-tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.. L-DOPA is the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), which are collectively known as catecholamines. The Swedish scientist Arvid Carlsson first showed in the 1950s that administering L-DOPA to animals with drug-induced (reserpine) Parkinsonian symptoms caused a reduction in the intensity of the animals' symptoms. Unlike dopamine itself, L-DOPA can be taken orally and crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is rapidly taken up by dopaminergic neurons and converted to dopamine. In particular, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor for this decarboxylation, and may be administered along with levodopa, usually as pyridoxine. As a result, L-DOPA is a drug that is now used for the treatment of Parkinsonian disorders and DOPA-Responsive Dystonia. It is usually given with agents that inhibit its conversion to dopamine outside of the central nervous system. It is standard clinical practice in treating Parkinsonism to co-administer a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor - carbidopa or benserazide - and often a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, to prevent synthesis of dopamine in peripheral tissue. Side effects of L-DOPA treatment may include: hypertension, arrhythmias, nausea, gastrointestinal bleeding, disturbed respiration, hair loss, disorientation and confusion. L-DOPA can act as an L-tyrosine mimetic and be incorporated into proteins by mammalian cells in place of L-tyrosine, generating protease-resistant and aggregate-prone proteins in vitro and may contribute to neurotoxicity with chronic L-DOPA administration. L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-DOPA are all precursors to the biological pigment melanin. The enzyme tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of L-DOPA to the reactive intermediate dopaquinone, which reacts further, eventually leading to melanin oligomers.",C9H11NO4,197.1879,197.068807845,"(2S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid",levodopa,59-92-7,N[C@@H](CC1=CC=C(O)C(O)=C1)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C9H11NO4/c10-6(9(13)14)3-5-1-2-7(11)8(12)4-5/h1-2,4,6,11-12H,3,10H2,(H,13,14)/t6-/m0/s1",WTDRDQBEARUVNC-LURJTMIESA-N,Solid,5824.0,DB01235,FDB000567,6047.0,,15765.0,,C00001357,C00355,L-DIHYDROXY-PHENYLALANINE,34719.0,Levodopa,42.0,34DHPHE,,"Haneda, Katsuji; Watanabe, Shiro; Takeda, Isao.

Lysine is high in foods such as wheat germ, cottage cheese and chicken. Of meat products, wild game and pork have the highest concentration of lysine. Fruits and vegetables contain little lysine, except avocados. Normal requirements for lysine have been found to be about 8 g per day or 12 mg/kg in adults. Children and infants need more, 44 mg/kg per day for an eleven to-twelve-year old, and 97 mg/kg per day for three-to six-month old. In organisms that synthesise lysine, it has two main biosynthetic pathways, the diaminopimelate and Œ±-aminoadipate pathways, which employ distinct enzymes and substrates and are found in diverse organisms. Lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways, the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway. Lysine plays several roles in humans, most importantly proteinogenesis, but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides, uptake of essential mineral nutrients, and in the production of carnitine, which is key in fatty acid metabolism. Lysine is also often involved in histone modifications, and thus, impacts the epigenome. Lysine is highly concentrated in muscle compared to most other amino acids. Normal lysine metabolism is dependent upon many nutrients including niacin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin C, glutamic acid and iron. Excess arginine antagonizes lysine. Several inborn errors of lysine metabolism are known, such as cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, lysinuric protein intolerance, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I. Most are marked by mental retardation with occasional diverse symptoms such as absence of secondary sex characteristics, undescended testes, abnormal facial structure, anemia, obesity, enlarged liver and spleen, and eye muscle imbalance. Lysine also may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although high protein diets result in loss of large amounts of calcium in urine, so does lysine deficiency. Lysine may be an adjunct therapy because it reduces calcium losses in urine. Lysine deficiency also may result in immunodeficiency. Requirements for lysine are probably increased by stress. Lysine toxicity has not occurred with oral doses in humans. Lysine dosages are presently too small and may fail to reach the concentrations necessary to prove potential therapeutic applications. Lysine metabolites, amino caproic acid and carnitine have already shown their therapeutic potential. Thirty grams daily of amino caproic acid has been used as an initial daily dose in treating blood clotting disorders, indicating that the proper doses of lysine, its precursor, have yet to be used in medicine. Low lysine levels have been found in patients with Parkinson's, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, asthma and depression. The exact significance of these levels is unclear, yet lysine therapy can normalize the level and has been associated with improvement of some patients with these conditions. Abnormally elevated hydroxylysines have been found in virtually all chronic degenerative diseases and those treated with coumadin therapy. The levels of this stress marker may be improved by high doses of vitamin C. Lysine is particularly useful in therapy for marasmus (wasting) (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-serine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Serine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as a polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. In humans, serine is a nonessential amino acid that can be easily derived from glycine. A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. Like all the amino acid building blocks of protein and peptides, serine can become essential under certain conditions, and is thus important in maintaining health and preventing disease. L-Serine may be derived from four possible sources: dietary intake; biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate; from glycine; and by protein and phospholipid degradation. Little data is available on the relative contributions of each of these four sources of l-serine to serine homoeostasis. It is very likely that the predominant source of l-serine will be very different in different tissues and during different stages of human development. In the biosynthetic pathway, the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphohydroxypyruvate, in a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3- PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95). Phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized to phosphoserine by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) and, finally, phosphoserine is converted into l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP; EC 3.1.3.3). In liver tissue, the serine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in response to dietary and hormonal changes. Of the three synthetic enzymes, the properties of 3-PGDH and PSP are the best documented. Hormonal factors such as glucagon and corticosteroids also influence 3-PGDH and PSP activities in interactions dependent upon the diet. L-serine is the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate. It has long been recognized that, in cell cultures, L-serine is a conditional essential amino acid, because it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet the cellular demands for its utilization. In recent years, L-serine and the products of its metabolism have been recognized not only to be essential for cell proliferation, but also to be necessary for specific functions in the central nervous system. The findings of altered levels of serine and glycine in patients with psychiatric disorders and the severe neurological abnormalities in patients with defects of L-serine synthesis underscore the importance of L-serine in brain development and function.

It is classified as a polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. In humans, serine is a nonessential amino acid that can be easily derived from glycine. A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. Like all the amino acid building blocks of protein and peptides, serine can become essential under certain conditions, and is thus important in maintaining health and preventing disease. L-Serine may be derived from four possible sources: dietary intake; biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate; from glycine; and by protein and phospholipid degradation. Little data is available on the relative contributions of each of these four sources of l-serine to serine homoeostasis. It is very likely that the predominant source of l-serine will be very different in different tissues and during different stages of human development. In the biosynthetic pathway, the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphohydroxypyruvate, in a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3- PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95). Phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized to phosphoserine by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) and, finally, phosphoserine is converted into l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP; EC 3.1.3.3). In liver tissue, the serine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in response to dietary and hormonal changes. Of the three synthetic enzymes, the properties of 3-PGDH and PSP are the best documented. Hormonal factors such as glucagon and corticosteroids also influence 3-PGDH and PSP activities in interactions dependent upon the diet. L-serine is the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate. It has long been recognized that, in cell cultures, L-serine is a conditional essential amino acid, because it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet the cellular demands for its utilization. In recent years, L-serine and the products of its metabolism have been recognized not only to be essential for cell proliferation, but also to be necessary for specific functions in the central nervous system. The findings of altered levels of serine and glycine in patients with psychiatric disorders and the severe neurological abnormalities in patients with defects of L-serine synthesis underscore the importance of L-serine in brain development and function.

It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1-2 mmol/L at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favourable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

Optimizing glutathione levels in macrophages and astrocytes with cystine allows these cells to provide cysteine to lymphocytes and neurons directly upon demand (Wikipedia).",C6H12N2O4S2,240.3,240.023848262,(2R)-2-amino-3-{[(2R)-2-amino-2-carboxyethyl]disulfanyl}propanoic acid,L-cystine,56-89-3,N[C@@H](CSSC[C@H](N)C(O)=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C6H12N2O4S2/c7-3(5(9)10)1-13-14-2-4(8)6(11)12/h3-4H,1-2,7-8H2,(H,9,10)(H,11,12)/t3-,4-/m0/s1",LEVWYRKDKASIDU-IMJSIDKUSA-N,Solid,60997.0,DB00138,FDB012672,67678.0,,16283.0,,C00001352,C00491,,35134.0,Cystine,5207.0,LCYSTIN,,"Grossi, Loris; Montevecchi, Pier Carlo.

It is a derivative of carnosine, which had been methylated. The methyl group of anserine is added to carnosine by the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine: carnosine N-methyltransferase (PMID: 29484990). The enzyme is closely related to histamine N-methyltransferase and appears to be present in a majority of anserine-producing species (PMID: 23705015). Anserine is a generally a more metabolically stable derivative of carnosine. Anserine can be found in the skeletal muscle and brain of certain mammals (rabbits, cattle), migratory fish and birds. This dipeptide is normally absent from human tissues and body fluids, and its appearance there is usually an artifact of diet. Anserine can also arise from serum carnosinase deficiency. (OMIM 212200). Anserine was first discovered in goose muscle in 1929, and was named after this extraction (anser is Latin for goose). Anserine, which is water-soluble, is found at high levels in the muscles of different non-human vertebrates, with poultry, rabbit, tuna, plaice, and salmon having generally higher contents than other marine foods, beef, or pork (PMID: 31908682). An increase of urinary anserine excretion has been found in humans after the consumption of chicken, rabbit, and tuna and has been associated with intake of chicken, salmon, and, to a lesser extent, beef (PMID: 31908682).  Anserine can undergo cleavage to give rise to 3-methylhistidine.(3-MH). The dipeptide balenine, common in some whales, cleaves to form 1-methylhistidine (1-MH) (PMID: 31908682).  There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (N-pi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption of certain foods or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH or vice versa (PMID: 24137022). In particular balenine (a whale or snake-specific dipeptide with 1MH) was often confused with anserine (the poultry dipeptide with 3MH). An animal model study of Alzheimer's disease using mice found that treatment with anserine reduced memory loss (PMID: 28974740). Anserine reduced glial inflammatory activity (particularly of astrocyte). The study also found that anserine-treated mice had greater pericyte surface area. The greater area of pericytes was commensurate with improved memory. The anserine-treated mice overall performed better on a spatial memory test (Morris Water Maze) (PMID: 28974740). A human study on 84 elderly subjects showed that subjects who took anserine and carnosine supplements for one year showed increased blood flow in the prefrontal cortex on MRI (PMID: 29896423).",C10H16N4O3,240.259,240.122240398,(2S)-2-(3-aminopropanamido)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)propanoic acid,anserine,584-85-0,CN1C=NC=C1C[C@H](NC(=O)CCN)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C10H16N4O3/c1-14-6-12-5-7(14)4-8(10(16)17)13-9(15)2-3-11/h5-6,8H,2-4,11H2,1H3,(H,13,15)(H,16,17)/t8-/m0/s1",MYYIAHXIVFADCU-QMMMGPOBSA-N,Solid,100482.0,,FDB021903,112072.0,,18323.0,,C00052191,C01262,CPD-401,,Anserine,5209.0,,,"Yudaev, N.

Inosine is an intermediate in the degradation of purines and purine nucleosides to uric acid. Inosine is also an intermediate in the purine salvage pathway. Inosine occurs in the anticodon of certain transfer RNA molecules and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Inosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Inosine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, inosine can be biosynthesized from inosinic acid through its interaction with the enzyme known as cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase. In addition, inosine can be converted into hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate through its interaction with the enzyme known as purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Altered levels of inosine have also been associated with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency and xanthinuria type I, both of which are inborn errors of metabolism.

IAA frequently occurs at low levels in urine and has been found in elevated levels in the urine of patients with phenylketonuria (PMID: 13610897). IAA has also been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821).

Specifically, IAA is a member of the group of phytohormones called auxins. IAA is generally considered to be the most important native auxin. Plant cells synthesize IAA from tryptophan (Wikipedia). IAA and some derivatives can be oxidized by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into cytotoxic species. IAA is only toxic after oxidative decarboxylation; the effect of IAA/HRP is thought to be due in part to the formation of methylene-oxindole, which may conjugate with DNA bases and protein thiols.

In particular, the coenzyme A-linked form of methylmalonic acid, methylmalonyl-CoA, is converted into succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. In this way, methylmalonic acid enters the Krebs cycle and is thus part of one of the anaplerotic reactions. Abnormalities in methylmalonic acid metabolism lead to methylmalonic aciduria. This inborn error of metabolism is attributed to a block in the enzymatic conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA. Methylmalonic acid is also found to be associated with other inborn errors of metabolism, including cobalamin deficiency, cobalamin malabsorption, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and transcobalamin II deficiency. When present in sufficiently high levels, methylmalonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methylmalonic acid are associated with at least 5 inborn errors of metabolism, including Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency, Malonic Aciduria, Methylmalonate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Methylmalonic Aciduria and Methylmalonic Aciduria Due to Cobalamin-Related Disorders. Methylmalonic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above.

In the TCA cycle, AKG is decarboxylated to succinyl-CoA and carbon dioxide by AKG dehydrogenase, which functions as a key control point of the TCA cycle. Additionally, AKG can be generated from isocitrate by oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the enzyme known as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In addition to these routes of production, AKG can be produced from glutamate by oxidative deamination via glutamate dehydrogenase, and as a product of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination reactions (mediated by branched-chain amino acid transaminases) in which glutamate is a common amino donor. AKG is a nitrogen scavenger and a source of glutamate and glutamine that stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation in muscles. In particular, AKG can decrease protein catabolism and increase protein synthesis to enhance bone tissue formation in skeletal muscles (PMID: 26759695). Interestingly, enteric feeding of AKG supplements can significantly increase circulating plasma levels of hormones such as insulin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (PMID: 26759695). It has recently been shown that AKG can extend the lifespan of adult C. elegans by inhibiting ATP synthase and TOR (PMID: 24828042).

L-alpha-amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. L-ornithine is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound. Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle. It is considered to be a non-essential amino acid. A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. L-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, creating urea. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Outside the human body, L-ornithine is abundant in a number of food items such as wild rice, brazil nuts, common oregano, and common grapes. L-ornithine can be found throughout most human tissues; and in most biofluids, some of which include blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sweat, saliva, and feces. L-ornithine exists in all living species, from bacteria to plants to humans. L-Ornithine is also a precursor of citrulline and arginine. In order for ornithine that is produced in the cytosol to be converted to citrulline, it must first cross the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it is carbamylated by the enzyme known as ornithine transcarbamylase. This transfer is mediated by the mitochondrial ornithine transporter (SLC25A15; AF112968; ORNT1). Mutations in the mitochondrial ornithine transporter result in hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, a disorder of the urea cycle (PMID: 16256388). The pathophysiology of the disease may involve diminished ornithine transport into mitochondria, resulting in ornithine accumulation in the cytoplasm and reduced ability to clear carbamoyl phosphate and ammonia loads (OMIM 838970). In humans, L-ornithine is involved in a number of other metabolic disorders, some of which include, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency), argininemia, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency). Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Moreover, Ornithine is found to be associated with cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, and lysinuric protein intolerance, which are inborn errors of metabolism.

Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major body component of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21–30% (molar) of human depot fat (PMID: 13756126), and it is a major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk (PMID: 352132). Palmitic acid is used to produce soaps, cosmetics, and industrial mould release agents. These applications use sodium palmitate, which is commonly obtained by saponification of palm oil. To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm tree (species Elaeis guineensis), is treated with sodium hydroxide (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes hydrolysis of the ester groups, yielding glycerol and sodium palmitate. Aluminium salts of palmitic acid and naphthenic acid were combined during World War II to produce napalm. The word ""napalm"" is derived from the words naphthenic acid and palmitic acid (Wikipedia).

Phosphoethanolamines are compounds containing a phosphate linked to the second carbon of an ethanolamine. O-Phosphoethanolamine is used in the biosynthesis of two different types of phospholipids: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. O-Phosphoethanolamine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, O-phosphoethanolamine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, cytidine triphosphate and O-phosphoethanolamine can be converted into CDP-ethanolamine; which is mediated by the enzyme ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. In addition, O-phosphoethanolamine can be biosynthesized from ethanolamine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme choline/ethanolamine kinase. In humans, O-phosphoethanolamine is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. O-phosphoethanolamine is also a product of the metabolism of sphingolipids. In particular, sphinglipids are metabolized in vivo to phosphorylethanolamine and a fatty aldehyde, generally palmitaldehyde. Both metabolites are ultimately converted to glycerophospholipids. The lipids are first phosphorylated by a kinase and then cleaved by the pyridoxal-dependent sphinganine-1-phosphate aldolase. Elevated urine levels of O-Phosphoethanolamine or PEA can be used to help in the diagnosis of Hypophosphatasia (HPP). Reference ranges for urinary PEA vary according to age and somewhat by diet, and follow a circadian rhythm. Outside of the human body, O-phosphoethanolamine has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as oxheart cabbages, anises, shiitakes, abalones, and teffs.

That is it is a uracil bearing a carboxy substituent at position C-6. It is also classified as a pyrimidinedione and a carboxylic acid. Orotic acid is a minor dietary constituent. Indeed, until it was realized that it could be synthesized by humans, orotic acid was known as vitamin B-13. The richest dietary sources of orotic acid are cow's milk and other dairy products as well as root vegetables such as carrots and beets. Dietary intake probably contributes to a basal rate of orotic acid excretion in urine because fasting decreases excretion by ~50%. However, it is now apparent that most urinary orotic acid is synthesized in the body, where it arises as an intermediate in the pathway for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Orotic acid is converted to UMP by UMP synthase, a multifunctional protein with both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylate decarboxylase activity. The most frequently observed inborn error of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is a mutation of the multifunctional protein UMP synthase (UMP synthase deficiency or orotic aciduria). This disorder prevents the conversion of orotic acid to UMP, and thus to other pyrimidines. As a result, plasma orotic acid accumulates to high concentrations, and increased quantities appear in the urine. Indeed, urinary orotic acid is so markedly increased in individuals harboring a mutation in UMP synthase that orotic acid crystals can form in the urine. The urinary concentration of orotic acid in individuals suffering from orotic aciduria can be of the order of millimoles of orotic acid per millimole creatinine. By comparison, the urinary level in unaffected individuals is ~ 1 ¬¨umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 17513443). Orotic aciduria is characterized by megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid crystalluria that is frequently associated with some degree of physical and mental retardation. These features respond to appropriate pyrimidine replacement therapy and most cases appear to have a good prognosis. When present in sufficiently high levels, orotic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of orotic acid are associated with at least seven inborn errors of metabolism, including argininemia, LPI syndrome (lysinuric protein intolerance), hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH), OTC deficiency, citrullinemia type I, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, and orotic aciduria. Orotic acid is broadly classified as an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",C5H4N2O4,156.0963,156.017106626,"2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid",orotic acid,65-86-1,OC(=O)C1=CC(=O)NC(=O)N1,"InChI=1S/C5H4N2O4/c8-3-1-2(4(9)10)6-5(11)7-3/h1H,(H,9,10)(H2,6,7,8,11)",PXQPEWDEAKTCGB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,942.0,DB02262,FDB031072,967.0,,16742.0,,C00019689,C00295,OROTATE,34527.0,Orotic_acid,318.0,OROT,,"Mitchell, Herschel K.; Nyc, Joseph F.

It is also used in the production of drugs (it is the starting material in the industrial production of aspirin), weedkillers, and synthetic resins.

Thiamines are compounds containing a thiamine moiety, which is structurally characterized by a 3-[(4-Amino-2-methyl-pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]-4-methyl-thiazol-5-yl backbone. Thiamine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans.  Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. Thiamine is a vitamin and an essential nutrient meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. It is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered in 1897 by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine was the first B vitamin to be isolated in 1926 and was first made in 1936. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue. Thiamine has antioxidant, erythropoietic, cognition-and mood-modulatory, antiatherosclerotic, putative ergogenic, and detoxification activities. Natural derivatives of thiamine, such as thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), act as coenzymes in addition to performing unique biological functions. Thiamine deficiency can lead to beriberi, Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. In Western countries, thiamine deficiency is seen mainly in chronic alcoholism. Thiamine supplements or thiamine therapy can be used for the treatment of a number of disorders including thiamine and niacin deficiency states, Korsakov's alcoholic psychosis, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, delirium, and peripheral neuritis. In humans, thiamine is involved in the metabolic disorder called 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Outside of the human body, Thiamine is found in high quantities in whole grains, legumes, pork, fruits, and yeast and fish. Grain processing removes much of the thiamine content in grains, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine.",C12H17N4OS,265.355,265.112306876,"3-[(4-amino-2-methylpyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-3-ium",thiamine,70-16-6,CC1=C(CCO)SC=[N+]1CC1=CN=C(C)N=C1N,"InChI=1S/C12H17N4OS/c1-8-11(3-4-17)18-7-16(8)6-10-5-14-9(2)15-12(10)13/h5,7,17H,3-4,6H2,1-2H3,(H2,13,14,15)/q+1",JZRWCGZRTZMZEH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,1098.0,DB00152,FDB008424,1130.0,,18385.0,,C00000775,C00378,THIAMINE,,Thiamine,,THM,,"Sugimoto, Hirohiko; Ishiba, Teruyuki; Sato, Tomohiro; Nakai, Hiroshi; Hirai, Kentaro.

It exists a clear liquid with a pungent and unpleasant smell somewhat resembling body odor. Propionic acid (PA) is widely used as an antifungal agent in food. It is present naturally at low levels in dairy products and occurs ubiquitously, together with other short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), in the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and other mammals as an end-product of the microbial digestion of carbohydrates. The metabolism of propionic acid begins with its conversion to propionyl coenzyme A, the usual first step in the metabolism of carboxylic acids. Since propionic acid has three carbons, propionyl-CoA cannot directly enter either beta oxidation or the citric acid cycles. In most vertebrates, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerised to L-methylmalonyl-CoA. Propionic acid has significant physiological activity in animals. Propionic acid is irritant but produces no acute systemic effects and has no demonstrable genotoxic potential (PMID 1628870). The human skin is host of several species of bacteria known as Propionibacteria, which are named after their ability to produce propionic acid. The most notable one is the Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes), which lives mainly in the sebaceous glands of the skin and is one of the principal causes of acne. Propionic aciduria is one of the most frequent organic acidurias, a disease that comprise many various disorders. The outcome of patients born with Propionic aciduria is poor intellectual development patterns, with 60% having an IQ less than 75 and requiring special education. Successful liver and/or renal transplantations, in a few patients, have resulted in better quality of life but have not necessarily prevented neurological and various visceral complications. These results emphasize the need for permanent metabolic follow-up whatever the therapeutic strategy (PMID 15868474).

Pyridoxine is an essential nutrient, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Sources in the diet include fruit, vegetables, and grain. Although pyridoxine and vitamin B6 are still frequently used as synonyms, especially by medical researchers, this practice is sometimes misleading (PMID: 2192605). Technically, pyridoxine is one of the compounds that can be called vitamin B6 or it is a member of the family of B6 vitamins. Healthy human blood levels of pyridoxine are 2.1 - 21.7 ng/mL. Pyridoxine is readily converted to pyridoxal phosphate which is a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids and aminolevulinic acid. Pyridoxine assists in the balancing of sodium and potassium as well as promoting red blood cell production. Therefore pyridoxine is required by the body to make amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. It is linked to cancer immunity and helps fight the formation of homocysteine. It has been suggested that pyridoxine might help children with learning difficulties, and may also prevent dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis. In addition, pyridoxine can help balance hormonal changes in women and aid in immune system. Lack of pyridoxine may cause anemia, nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth (Wikipedia). Deficiency of pyridoxine, though rare because of widespread distribution in foods, leads to the development of peripheral neuritis in adults and affects the central nervous system in children (DOSE - 3rd edition). As a supplement pyridoxine is used to treat and prevent pyridoxine deficiency, sideroblastic anaemia, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, certain metabolic disorders, problems from isoniazid, and certain types of mushroom poisoning.

Pyruvate is the simplest alpha-keto acid and according to official nomenclature by IUPAC, it is called alpha-keto propanoic acid. Like other keto acids, pyruvic acid can tautomerize from its ketone form to its enol form, containing a double bond and an alcohol. Pyruvate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. It is intermediate compound in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in several metabolic pathways throughout the cell. In particular, pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a reaction with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking (lactic acid). In glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible. In gluconeogenesis, it takes two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP.

The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by enzymes known as deiodinases (5‚Ä≤-iodinase). Thyroxine is synthesized via the iodination of tyrosines (monoiodotyrosine) and the coupling of iodotyrosines (diiodotyrosine) in the thyroglobulin. Iodine is critical to the synthesis of thyroxine and other thyroid hormones. Through a reaction with the enzyme thyroperoxidase, iodine is covalently bound to tyrosine residues found in the thyroglobulin protein, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Linking two moieties of DIT produces thyroxine. Combining one molecule of MIT and one molecule of DIT produces triiodothyronine. Thyroxine is released from thyroglobulin by proteolysis and secreted into the blood. Iodide is actively absorbed from the bloodstream and concentrated in the thyroid follicles where thyroxine is produced. If there is a deficiency of dietary iodine, the thyroid enlarges in an attempt to trap more iodine, resulting in a condition called goitre. More specifically, the lack of thyroid hormones will lead to decreased negative feedback on the pituitary gland, leading to increased production of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the thyroid to enlarge, leading to goitre. Thyroxine can be peripherally de-iodinated to form triiodothyronine which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism.  Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism. Numerous physiological and pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis.

Adults can synthesize their own taurine, yet are probably dependent, in part, on dietary taurine. Taurine is abundant in the brain, heart, breast, gallbladder, and kidney and has important roles in health and disease in these organs.

Perry syndrome is an unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through three generations of a family. Symptoms began late in the fifth decade in 6 affected persons and death occurred after 4 to 6 years. The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental depression that was not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Sleep disturbances, exhaustion, and marked weight loss were features. Parkinsonism developed later, and respiratory failure occurred terminally (OMIM: 168605).

In two with mitral valve prolapse, congestive cardiomyopathy eventually developed while the amounts of urinary taurine doubled (OMIM: 145350). Taurine, after GABA, is the second most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its inhibitory effect is one source of taurine's anticonvulsant and antianxiety properties. It also lowers glutamic acid in the brain, and preliminary clinical trials suggest taurine may be useful in some forms of epilepsy. Taurine in the brain is usually associated with zinc or manganese.

It is an important component of the citric acid or TCA cycle and is capable of donating electrons to the electron transfer chain. Succinate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to mammals. In eukaryotes, succinate is generated in the mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Succinate can readily be imported into the mitochondrial matrix by the n-butylmalonate- (or phenylsuccinate-) sensitive dicarboxylate carrier in exchange with inorganic phosphate or another organic acid, e. g. malate (PMID 16143825). Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space. Succinate has multiple biological roles including roles as a metabolic intermediate and roles as a cell signalling molecule. Succinate can alter gene expression patterns, thereby modulating the epigenetic landscape or it can exhibit hormone-like signaling functions (PMID: 26971832). As such, succinate links cellular metabolism, especially ATP formation, to the regulation of cellular function. Succinate can be broken down or metabolized into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is part of the electron transport chain involved in making ATP. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis, and therefore ATP synthesis, can happen in a number of genetic mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome, and Melas syndrome. Succinate has been found to be associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Succinic acid has recently been identified as an oncometabolite or an endogenous, cancer causing metabolite. High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation.

Succinate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to mammals. In eukaryotes, succinate is generated in the mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Succinate can readily be imported into the mitochondrial matrix by the n-butylmalonate- (or phenylsuccinate-) sensitive dicarboxylate carrier in exchange with inorganic phosphate or another organic acid, e. g. malate (PMID 16143825). Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space. Succinate has multiple biological roles including roles as a metabolic intermediate and roles as a cell signalling molecule. Succinate can alter gene expression patterns, thereby modulating the epigenetic landscape or it can exhibit hormone-like signaling functions (PMID: 26971832). As such, succinate links cellular metabolism, especially ATP formation, to the regulation of cellular function. Succinate can be broken down or metabolized into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is part of the electron transport chain involved in making ATP. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis, and therefore ATP synthesis, can happen in a number of genetic mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome, and Melas syndrome. Succinate has been found to be associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism.

An indoleamine consists of an indole ring that bears an amino group or an alkyl amino group attached to the indole ring. Serotonin has an aminoethyl at position 2 and a hydroxyl group at position 5 of the indole ring. Serotonin exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. In mammals, serotonin functions as a monoamine neurotransmitter, a biochemical messenger and regulator. It is synthesized from the essential amino acid L-Tryptophan. Approximately 90% of the human body's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract, where it regulates intestinal movements. About 8% is found in platelets and 1‚Äì2% in the CNS. Serotonin in the nervous system acts as a local transmitter at synapses, and as a paracrine or hormonal modulator of circuits upon diffusion, allowing a wide variety of ""state-dependent"" behavioral responses to different stimuli. Serotonin is widely distributed in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates and some of its behavioral effects have been preserved along evolution. Such is the case of aggressive behavior and rhythmic motor patterns, including those responsible for feeding.  In vertebrates, which display a wider and much more sophisticated behavioral repertoire, serotonin also modulates sleep, the arousal state, sexual behavior, and others. Deficiencies of the serotonergic system causes disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and generalized anxiety disorder. Serotonin has three different modes of action in the nervous system: as transmitter, acting locally at synaptic boutons; upon diffusion at a distance from its release sites, producing paracrine (also called volume) effects, and by circulating in the blood stream, producing hormonal effects. The three modes can affect a single neuronal circuit. (PMID: 16047543). Serotonin is also a microbial metabolite that can be found in the feces and urine of mammals. Urinary serotonin is produced by Candida, Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterococcus (PMID: 24621061). In plants, serotonin was first found and reported in a legume called Mucuna pruriens.

ATP is one of the major currencies of chemical energy within cells. In gluconeogenesis, PEP is formed from the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate and hydrolysis of 1 guanosine triphosphate molecule.

Sarcosine is ubiquitous in biological materials and is present in such foods as egg yolks, turkey, ham, vegetables, legumes, etc. Sarcosine is formed from dietary intake of choline and from the metabolism of methionine, and is rapidly degraded to glycine. Sarcosine has no known toxicity, as evidenced by the lack of phenotypic manifestations of sarcosinemia, an inborn error of sarcosine metabolism. Sarcosinemia can result from severe folate deficiency because of the folate requirement for the conversion of sarcosine to glycine (Wikipedia).

These are purine derivatives with a ketone group conjugated at carbons 2 and 6 of the purine moiety. Xanthine is also classified as an oxopurine. An oxopurine in which the purine ring is substituted by oxo groups at positions 2 and 6 and N-9 is protonated. Xanthine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. In plants, several stimulants can be derived from xanthine, including caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine. Derivatives of xanthine (known collectively as xanthines) are a group of alkaloids commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and as bronchodilators, notably in the treatment of asthma or influenza symptoms. Within humans, xanthine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, xanthine can be biosynthesized from guanine; which is mediated by the enzyme guanine deaminase. In addition, xanthine and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from xanthosine through the action of the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. In humans and other primates, xanthine can be converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme. People with rare genetic disorders, specifically xanthinuria and Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome, lack sufficient xanthine oxidase and cannot convert xanthine to uric acid. Individuals with xanthinuria have unusually high concentrations of xanthine in their blood and urine, which can lead to health problems such as renal failure and xanthine kidney stones. Individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome have a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The HGPRT deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. This results in both high levels of uric acid in the blood and urine, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability.

In the liver, urocanic acid is an intermediate in the conversion of histidine to glutamic acid, whereas, in the epidermis, it accumulates and may be both a UV protectant and an immunoregulator. Urocanic acid (UA) exists as a trans isomer (t-UA, approximately 30 mg/cm2) in the uppermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum). t-UA is formed as the cells of the second layer of the skin become metabolically inactive. During this process, proteins and membranes degrade, histidine is released, and histidase (histidine ammonia lyase) catalyzes the deamination of histidine to form t-UA. t-UA accumulates in the epidermis until removal by either the monthly skin renewal cycle or sweat. Upon absorption of UV light, the naturally occurring t-UA isomerizes to its cis form, c-UA. Because DNA lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers) in the lower epidermis can result from UV-B absorption, initial research proposed that t-UA acted as a natural sunscreen absorbing UV-B in the stratum corneum before the damaging rays could penetrate into lower epidermal zones. Researchers have found that c-UA also suppresses contact hypersensitivity and delayed hypersensitivity, reduces the Langerhans cell count in the epidermis, prolongs skin-graft survival time, and affects natural killer cell activity.

It is produced by defective or inefficient versions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, an enzyme that normally catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. If this enzyme is defective, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA will accumulate in the mitochondria. Increased concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these CoA end products occurs via the transfer of the 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl moiety to carnitine, forming 3-hydroxymethylglutaric-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane where 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid is released as the free acid. 3-Hydroxymethylglutaric acid has been found to accumulate in the urine of patients affected by 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, a rare inborn error of metabolism (OMIM: 246450). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria is caused by significantly reduced enzyme activity of the intramitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of leucine degradation.  This enzyme also plays a key role in ketone body formation. The profile of urinary organic acids for individuals with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria is different from that of the other identified defects of leucine degradation, such as maple syrup urine disease (OMIM: 248600), isovaleric acidemia (OMIM: 243500), and methylcrotonylglycinemia (OMIM: 210200). The urinary organic acid profile of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria includes elevated concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-isovaleric, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-methylglutaconic, and 3-methylglutaric acids (PMID: 10916782, 9658458, 3063529). Clinical manifestations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria include hepatomegaly, lethargy, coma, and apnea. Biochemically, there is a characteristic absence of ketosis with hypoglycemia, acidosis, hypertransaminasemia, and variable hyperammonemia. Therefore, when present in sufficiently high concentrations, 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. As noted above, chronically high levels of 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid are associated with the inborn error of metabolism 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. 3-Hydroxymethylglutaric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",C6H10O5,162.1406,162.05282343,3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanedioic acid,meglutol,503-49-1,CC(O)(CC(O)=O)CC(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C6H10O5/c1-6(11,2-4(7)8)3-5(9)10/h11H,2-3H2,1H3,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)",NPOAOTPXWNWTSH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,1600.0,DB04377,FDB004207,1662.0,,16831.0,,C00001187,C03761,CPD-547,,,5344.0,,,"Klosterman, Harold J.; Smith, F.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-lysine. Unlike L-lysine, acetylated lysine derivatives such as N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine are zwitterionic compounds. These are molecules that contains an equal number of positively- and negatively-charged functional groups. N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine is found naturally in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to plants to humans. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free lysine can also occur. In particular, N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine can be biosynthesized from L-lysine and acetyl-CoA via the enzyme known as Lysine N-acetyltransferase.  Individuals with hyperlysinaemia due to L-lysine alpha-ketoglutarate reductase deficiency will excrete high levels of N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine in their urine (PMID: 116084). L-lysine alpha-ketoglutarate reductase deficiency, if untreated, can lead to neurological and behavioral deficits (PMID: 116084). Many N-acetylamino acids are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",C8H16N2O3,188.227,188.116092383,(2S)-6-amino-2-acetamidohexanoic acid,nα-acetyllysine,1946-82-3,CC(=O)N[C@@H](CCCCN)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C8H16N2O3/c1-6(11)10-7(8(12)13)4-2-3-5-9/h7H,2-5,9H2,1H3,(H,10,11)(H,12,13)/t7-/m0/s1",VEYYWZRYIYDQJM-ZETCQYMHSA-N,Solid,83869.0,,FDB112380,92907.0,,35704.0,,C00052355,C12989,N-ACETYL-L-LYSINE,,Acetyllysine,5435.0,,,"Akagi, Aru; Soejima, Yasuhiro; Izumiya, Nobuo.

It occurs naturally in feces, beets, and coal tar, and has a strong fecal odor. Its name is derived from skato, the Greek word for dung. It exists as a white crystalline or fine powder solid, and it browns upon aging. 3-Methylindole is produced from tryptophan in the mammalian digestive tract where tryptophan is converted to indoleacetic acid, which decarboxylates to give the methylindole. These reactions are largely driven by the microbiota in the digestive tract. 3-Methylindole is soluble in alcohol and benzene and it gives violet color in potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6.3H2O) mixed with sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Skatole has a double ring system which displays aromaticity that comes from the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen. It is continuous (all atoms in the ring are sp2 hybridized), planar, and follows the 4n+2 rule because it has 10 pi electrons. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, skatole was listed as one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. This is because in low concentrations skatole has a flowery smell and is found in several flowers and essential oils, including those of orange blossoms, jasmine, and Ziziphus mauritiana. As a result, skatole/3-methylindole is used as a fragrance and fixative in many perfumes and as a general aroma compound for other applications. 3-Methylindole has been found to be a bacterial metabolite of members of the Clostridium (PMID: 18223109) and Lactobacillus (PMID: 16345702) families. Skatole functions as an insect attractant and is one of many compounds that are attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait for these bees for study (PMID: 12647866). It is also known for being an attractant for the Tasmanian grass grub beetle (Aphodius tasmaniae). Skatole has also been shown to be an attractant to gravid mosquitoes in both field and laboratory conditions (PMID: 24242053).",C9H9N,131.1745,131.073499293,3-methyl-1H-indole,scatole,83-34-1,CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2,"InChI=1S/C9H9N/c1-7-6-10-9-5-3-2-4-8(7)9/h2-6,10H,1H3",ZFRKQXVRDFCRJG-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,6480.0,,FDB004302,6736.0,,9171.0,,C00001430,C08313,SKATOLE,,Skatole,5453.0,,,"Xu, Jianguo; Xu, Lili; Shi, Hongxin.

Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. 5hmU has been identified as a thymine base modification found in the genomes of a diverse range of organisms (PMID: 28137275). 5-hydroxymethyluracil has been detected in bacteriophages, dinoflagellates, leishmania, and in eukaryotic genomes where its level appears to be cell type-specific. 5-Hydroxymethyluracil  arises from the oxidation of thymine.  5-Hydroxymethyluracil is produced by the enzyme thymine dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.6) which catalyzes the chemical reaction thymine + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 <->  5-hydroxymethyluracil + succinate + CO2. The 3 substrates of this enzyme are thymine, 2-oxoglutarate, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 5-hydroxymethyluracil, succinate, and CO2. The 5hmU base can also be generated by oxidation/hydroxylation of thymine by the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins or result from deamination of 5hmC (PMID: 29184924).

The conversion to serotonin is catalyzed by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) (AADC1 also known as DOPA decarboxylase), an essential enzyme in the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitters. An accumulation of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan in cerebrospinal fluid occurs in aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC deficiency) (OMIM: 608643) accompanied by an increased excretion in the urine of the patients, which are indicative of the disorder but not specific. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is also increased in other disorders such as in Parkinson's patients with severe postural instability and gait disorders. The amount of endogenous 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.52), and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) (EC 1.13.11.11). 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been used clinically for over 30 years. In addition to its use in the treatment of depression, the therapeutic administration of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been shown to be effective in treating a wide variety of conditions, including fibromyalgia, insomnia, binge eating associated with obesity, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic headaches. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and effectively increases central nervous system (CNS) synthesis of serotonin. Supplementation with 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan is hypothesized to normalize serotonin synthesis, which is putatively related to its antidepressant properties (PMID: 9295177, 17240182, 16023217). When present in sufficiently high levels, 5-hydroxytryptophan can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells or tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Signs and symptoms of AADC deficiency generally appear in the first year of life. Affected infants may have severe developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle stiffness, difficulty moving, and involuntary writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis). They may be lacking in energy (lethargic), feed poorly, startle easily, and have sleep disturbances. Since 5-hydroxytryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, altered levels of serotonin can accumulate in the brain, which leads to abnormal neural signalling. Infants with AADC deficiency have very low levels of neural signalling molecules while individuals who consume high levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan will have very high levels of neural signalling molecules. Both conditions can lead to vomiting, nausea, extreme drowsiness, and lethargy. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan (INN) is sold over-the-counter in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid. It is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under trade names such as Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. Several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, though a lack of high-quality studies has been noted.

It is an intermediate in the metabolism (i.e. breakdown or degradation) of lysine and saccharopine. It antagonizes neuroexcitatory activity modulated by the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Aminoadipic acid has also been shown to inhibit the production of kynurenic acid, a broad spectrum excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, in brain tissue slices (PMID: 8566117). Recent studies have shown that aminoadipic acid is elevated in prostate biopsy tissues from prostate cancer patients (PMID: 23737455). Mutations in DHTKD1 (dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1) have been shown to cause human 2-aminoadipic aciduria and 2-oxoadipic aciduria via impaired decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, which is the last step in the lysine degradation pathway (PMID: 23141293). Aging, diabetes, sepsis, and renal failure are known to catalyze the oxidation of lysyl residues to form 2-aminoadipic acid in human skin collagen and potentially other tissues (PMID: 18448817). Proteolytic breakdown of these tissues can lead to the release of free 2-aminoadipic acid. Studies in rats indicate that aminoadipic acid (along with the three branched-chain amino acids: leucine, valine, and isoleucine) levels are elevated in the pre-diabetic phase and so aminoadipic acid may serve as a predictive biomarker for the development of diabetes (PMID: 15389298). Long-term hyperglycemia of endothelial cells can also lead to elevated levels of aminoadipate which is thought to be a sign of lysine breakdown through oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PMID: 21961526). 2-Aminoadipate is a potential small-molecule marker of oxidative stress (PMID: 21647514). Therefore, depending on the circumstances aminoadipic acid can act as an acidogen, a diabetogen, an atherogen, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A diabetogen is a compound that can lead to type 2 diabetes. An atherogen is a compound that leads to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of aminoadipic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism including 2-aminoadipic aciduria and 2-oxoadipic aciduria. Aminoadipic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. As a diabetogen, serum aminoadipic levels appear to regulate glucose homeostasis and have been highly predictive of individuals who later develop diabetes (PMID: 24091325). In particular, aminoadipic acid lowers fasting plasma glucose levels and enhances insulin secretion from human islets. As an atherogen, aminoadipic acid has been found to be produced at high levels via protein lysine oxidation in atherosclerotic plaques (PMID: 28069522).",C6H11NO4,161.1558,161.068807845,(2S)-2-aminohexanedioic acid,aminoadipate,1118-90-7,N[C@@H](CCCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C6H11NO4/c7-4(6(10)11)2-1-3-5(8)9/h4H,1-3,7H2,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)/t4-/m0/s1",OYIFNHCXNCRBQI-BYPYZUCNSA-N,Solid,83182.0,,FDB021812,92136.0,,37023.0,,C00007393,C00956,CPD-468,,Alpha-Aminoadipic_acid,,L2AADP,,"Khan, Naseem H.; Ali, Mohd.; Panda, H.; Rakhshinda.

Arginine is an essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. It is classified as a charged, basic, aliphatic amino acid. Arginine is considered to be a basic amino acid as it has a strongly basic guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic, and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. L-Arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, and L-proline, and it can be converted into glucose and glycogen if needed. Arginine also plays an important role in cell division, immunity and wound healing. Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system's reaction to infection. Nitric oxide is made via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (PMID 10690324). Arginine is also a precursor for several important nitrogen-containing compounds including urea, ornithine, and agmatine.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetylglycine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetylglycine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid glycine. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylglycine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free glycine can also occur. In particular, N-Acetylglycine can be biosynthesized from glycine and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) (EC 2.3.1.13). Excessive amounts N-acetyl amino acids including N-acetylglycine (as well as N-acetylserine, N-acetylglutamine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylalanine, Nacetylmethionine and smaller amounts of N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylleucine, N-acetylvaline and N-acetylisoleucine) can be detected in the urine with individuals with acylase I deficiency, a genetic disorder (PMID: 16465618). Aminoacylase I is a soluble homodimeric zinc binding enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free aliphatic amino acids from N-acetylated precursors. In humans, Aminoacylase I is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (ACY1) on chromosome 3p21 that consists of 15 exons (OMIM 609924). Individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency will experience convulsions, hearing loss and difficulty feeding (PMID: 16465618). ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylglycine, are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",C4H7NO3,117.1033,117.042593095,2-acetamidoacetic acid,aceturate,543-24-8,CC(=O)NCC(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C4H7NO3/c1-3(6)5-2-4(7)8/h2H2,1H3,(H,5,6)(H,7,8)",OKJIRPAQVSHGFK-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,10507.0,DB02713,FDB022100,10972.0,,40410.0,,,,,,Aceturic acid,5517.0,,,"Lin, Jiang Jen; Knifton, John F.; Yeakey, Ernest L.

Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides. Caproic acid is a colourless oily liquid that smells like cheese with an overlying waxy or barnyard odor like that of goats or other barnyard animals. Its name comes from the Latin word capra, meaning ""goat"". Two other fatty acids are named after goats: caprylic acid (C8) and capric acid (C10). Along with caproic acid, they account for 15% of the fat in goat's milk. Caproic acid is a fatty acid found naturally in various animal fats and oils. While generally more abundant in animals, caproic acid is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. Caproic acid is one of the chemicals that gives the decomposing fleshy seed coat of the ginkgo fruit its characteristic unpleasant odor. It is also one of the components of vanilla and cheese. Industrially, the primary use of caproic acid is in the manufacture of its esters for use as artificial flavors and in the manufacture of hexyl derivatives, such as hexylphenols. Caproic acid has been associated with medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism. As a relatively volatile organic compound, caproic acid has been identified as a fecal biomarker of Clostridium difficile infection (PMID: 30986230).",C6H12O2,116.1583,116.083729628,,,142-62-1,CCCCCC(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C6H12O2/c1-2-3-4-5-6(7)8/h2-5H2,1H3,(H,7,8)",FUZZWVXGSFPDMH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,8552.0,,FDB013897,8892.0,,30776.0,,C00001218,C01585,HEXANOATE,,Hexanoic_acid,5520.0,,,"Gao, Fei; Wu, Zongwei.

Three phosphate groups are esterified at the fifth carbon atom of the ribose. ATP is incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription. ATP contributes to cellular energy charge and participates in overall energy balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATP can act as an extracellular signaling molecule via interactions with specific purinergic receptors to mediate a wide variety of processes as diverse as neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and bone remodelling. Extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have also been shown to exert a variety of effects on nearly every cell type in human skin, and ATP seems to play a direct role in triggering skin inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic responses to mechanical injury, an indirect role in melanocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and a complex role in Langerhans cell-directed adaptive immunity. During exercise, intracellular homeostasis depends on the matching of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and ATP demand. Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways.

Three phosphate groups are esterified at the fifth carbon atom of the ribose. ATP is incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription. ATP contributes to cellular energy charge and participates in overall energy balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATP can act as an extracellular signaling molecule via interactions with specific purinergic receptors to mediate a wide variety of processes as diverse as neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and bone remodelling. Extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have also been shown to exert a variety of effects on nearly every cell type in human skin, and ATP seems to play a direct role in triggering skin inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic responses to mechanical injury, an indirect role in melanocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and a complex role in Langerhans cell-directed adaptive immunity. During exercise, intracellular homeostasis depends on the matching of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and ATP demand. Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-alanine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Cysteine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar, sulfur-containing amino acid. Cysteine is an important source of sulfur in human metabolism, and although it is classified as a non-essential amino acid, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine can occasionally be considered as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid. Cysteine is unique amongst the twenty natural amino acids as it contains a thiol group. Thiol groups can undergo oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions; when cysteine is oxidized it can form cystine, which is two cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bond. This reaction is reversible since the reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins. Cysteine is often involved in electron-transfer reactions, and help the enzyme catalyze its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant glutathione. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a form of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to cysteine's nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word kustis meaning bladder (cystine was first isolated from kidney stones). Oxidation of cysteine can produce a disulfide bond with another thiol and further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or sulfonic acids. The cysteine thiol group is also a nucleophile and can undergo addition and substitution reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so they are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. The thiol group also has a high affinity for heavy metals and proteins containing cysteine will bind metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium tightly. Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine is important in energy metabolism. As cystine, it is a structural component of many tissues and hormones. Cysteine has clinical uses ranging from treating baldness to psoriasis to preventing smoker's hack. In some cases, oral cysteine therapy has proved excellent for treatment of asthmatics, enabling them to stop theophylline and other medications.

These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Glutaconic acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Glutaconic acid has been detected in the urine of individuals with inborn errors of metabolism. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaconic acid can act as an acidogen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A neurotoxin is a compound that is toxic to neural tissues and cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaconic acid are associated with glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. GA1 is associated with a risk for intracranial and retinal hemorrhage, and non-specific white matter changes. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. Seizures and coma (encephalopathy) are rare. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Glutaconic acid's neurotoxicity is thought to be partially caused by an excitotoxic mechanism in which glutaconic acid overactivates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.

Ethylmalonic acid can be synthesized from malonic acid, and can be synthesized into (S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA and (R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA. Ethylmalonic acid can be found in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, as well as in human fibroblasts, prostate, and skeletal muscle tissues. Moreover, ethylmalonic acid is found to be associated with anorexia nervosa and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Ethylmalonic acid is a non-carcinogenic (not listed by IARC) potentially toxic compound. Chronically high levels of ethylmalonic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency) and ethylmalonic encephalopathy.

Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above.

Gluconic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as sugar acids and derivatives. Sugar acids and derivatives are compounds containing a saccharide unit which bears a carboxylic acid group. In aqueous solution, gluconic acid exists in equilibrium with the cyclic ester glucono delta-lactone. Gluconic acid occurs naturally in fruit, honey, kombucha tea and wine. The salts of gluconic acid are known as ""gluconates"". Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Gluconic acid exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. The metabolism of gluconate is well characterized in prokaryotes where it is known to be degraded following phosphorylation by gluconokinase. Glucokinase activity has also been detected in mammals, including humans (PMID: 24896608). Gluconic acid is produced in the gluconate shunt pathway. In the gluconate shunt, glucose is oxidized by glucose dehydrogenase (also called glucose oxidase) to furnish gluconate, the form in which D-gluconic acid is present at physiological pH. Subsequently, gluconate is phosphorylated by the action of gluconate kinase to produce 6-phosphogluconate, which is the second intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. This gluconate shunt is mainly found in plants, algae, cyanobacteria and some bacteria, which all use the Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway to degrade glucose or gluconate; this generates 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate, which is then cleaved to generate pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate kinase activities are also present in mammals, fission yeast, and flies. Gluconic acid has many industrial uses. It is used as a drug as part of electrolyte supplementation in total parenteral nutrition. It is also used in cleaning products where it helps cleaning up mineral deposits. Gluconic acid or Gluconic acid is used to maintain the cation-anion balance on electrolyte solutions. In humans, gluconic acid is involved in the metabolic disorder called the transaldolase deficiency. Gluconic acid has been found to be a metabolite in Aspergillus (Hugo Vanden Bossche, D.W.R. Mackenzie and G. Cauwenbergh. Aspergillus and Aspergillosis, 1987).

Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. Cytosine is also classified as a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2). Cytosine is one of the four main bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine. In Watson-Crick base pairing, cytosine forms three hydrogen bonds with guanine. Cytosine was discovered and named by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf thymus tissues. Cytosine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within cells, cytosine can undergo several enzymatic reactions. It can be methylated into 5-methylcytosine by an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) or be methylated and hydroxylated to make 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family of enzymes transfer a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to the 5‚Äô carbon of cytosine in a molecule of DNA. High levels of cytosine can be found in the urine of individuals with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID). Cytosine concentrations as high as (23-160 mmol/mol creatinine) were detected in SCID patients compared to normal levels of <2 mmol/mol creatinine (PMID: 262183).",C4H5N3O,111.102,111.043261797,"6-amino-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one","2(1H)-pyrimidinone, 6-amino-",71-30-7,NC1=CC=NC(=O)N1,"InChI=1S/C4H5N3O/c5-3-1-2-6-4(8)7-3/h1-2H,(H3,5,6,7,8)",OPTASPLRGRRNAP-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,577.0,,FDB022151,597.0,,16040.0,,C00001498,C00380,CYTOSINE,34812.0,Cytosine,283.0,CSN,,"Hitchings, George H.; Elion, Gertrude B.; Falco, Elvira A.; Russell, Peter B.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Structurally, glutamine is similar to the amino acid glutamic acid. However, instead of having a terminal carboxylic acid, it has an amide. Glutamine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glutamine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals.  It is classified as an aliphatic, polar amino acid.  In humans glutamine is considered a non-essential amino acid. Enzymatically, glutamine is formed by replacing a side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group. More specifically, glutamine is synthesized by the enzyme glutamine synthetase from glutamate and ammonia. The most relevant glutamine-producing tissue are skeletal muscles, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. Dietary sources of glutamine include protein-rich foods such as beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices, wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery and kale. Glutamine is one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Glutamine is often used as a supplement in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance and other sports, as well as by those who suffer from muscular cramps or pain, particularly elderly people. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved L-glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac. The main use of glutamine within the diet of either group is as a means of replenishing the body's stores of amino acids that have been used during exercise or everyday activities. Studies which have looked into problems with excessive consumption of glutamine thus far have proved inconclusive. However, normal supplementation is healthy mainly because glutamine is supposed to be supplemented after prolonged periods of exercise (for example, a workout or exercise in which amino acids are required for use) and replenishes amino acid stores. This is one of the main reasons glutamine is recommended during fasting or for people who suffer from physical trauma, immune deficiencies, or cancer. There is a significant body of evidence that links glutamine-enriched diets with positive intestinal effects. These include maintenance of gut barrier function, aiding intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as generally reducing septic morbidity and the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The reason for such ""cleansing"" properties is thought to stem from the fact that the intestinal extraction rate of glutamine is higher than that for other amino acids, and is therefore thought to be the most viable option when attempting to alleviate conditions relating to the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions were discovered after comparing plasma concentration within the gut between glutamine-enriched and non glutamine-enriched diets. However, even though glutamine is thought to have ""cleansing"" properties and effects, it is unknown to what extent glutamine has clinical benefits, due to the varied concentrations of glutamine in varieties of food. It is also known that glutamine has positive effects in reducing healing time after operations. Hospital waiting times after abdominal surgery are reduced by providing parenteral nutrition regimens containing amounts of glutamine to patients. Clinical trials have revealed that patients on supplementation regimes containing glutamine have improved nitrogen balances, generation of cysteinyl-leukotrienes from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and improved lymphocyte recovery and intestinal permeability (in postoperative patients) - in comparison to those who had no glutamine within their dietary regime; all without any side-effects.

Glutaric acid is naturally produced in the body during the metabolism of some amino acids, including lysine and tryptophan. Glutaric acid may cause irritation to the skin and eyes. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaric acid are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism, including glutaric aciduria type I, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and glutaric aciduria type III. Glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1) is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs). Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because glutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated glutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. Treatment of glutaric aciduria is mainly based on the restriction of lysine intake, supplementation of carnitine, and an intensification of therapy during intercurrent illnesses. The major principle of dietary treatment is to reduce the production of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid by restriction of natural protein, in general, and of lysine, in particular (PMID: 17465389, 15505398).

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-leucine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Leucine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aliphatic amino acid. Leucine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. L-Leucine is a branched chain amino acid (BCAA).  The BCAAs consist of leucine, valine and isoleucine (and occasionally threonine). BCAAs are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point at the beta-carbon position. BCAAs are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. BCAAs have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates (glucogenic), leucine solely to fats (ketogenic) and isoleucine being both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. The primary metabolic end products of leucine metabolism are acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; consequently, it is one of the two exclusively ketogenic amino acids, with lysine being the other. Leucine is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans. The vast majority of l-leucine metabolism is initially catalyzed by the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase enzyme, producing alpha-ketoisocaproate (alpha-KIC). alpha-KIC is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which converts it to isovaleryl-CoA. Isovaleryl-CoA is subsequently metabolized by the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and converted to beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MC-CoA), which is used in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and other compounds. During biotin deficiency, HMB can be synthesized from MC-CoA via enoyl-CoA hydratase and an unknown thioesterase enzyme, which convert MC-CoA into HMB-CoA and HMB-CoA into HMB respectively.  Leucine has the capacity to directly stimulate myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis (PMID 15051860). This effect of leucine arises results from its role as an activator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PMID 23551944) a serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates protein biosynthesis and cell growth. The activation of mTOR by leucine is mediated through Rag GTPases.  Leucine, like other BCAAs, is associated with insulin resistance. In particular, higher levels of leucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans (PMID 25287287). BCAAs such as leucine have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Persistently low leucine levels can result in decreased appetite, poor feeding, lethargy, poor growth, weight loss, skin rashes, hair loss, and desquamation. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist and these are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAAs and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. - BCAAs are useful because they are metabolized primarily by muscle. Stress states - e.g surgery, trauma, cirrhosis, infections, fever and starvation--require proportionately more BCAAs than other amino acids and probably proportionately more leucine than either valine or isoleucine. BCAAs and other amino acids are frequently fed intravenously (TPN) to malnourished surgical patients and in some cases of severe trauma. BCAAs, particularly leucine, stimulate protein synthesis, increase reutilization of amino acids in many organs and reduce protein breakdown. Furthermore, leucine can be an important source of calories, and is superior as fuel to the ubiquitous intravenous glucose (dextrose). - Leucine also stimulates insulin release, which in turn stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown. These effects are particularly useful in athletic training. Huntington's chorea and anorexic disorders both are characterized by low serum BCAAs. These diseases, as well as forms of Parkinson's, may respond to BCAA therapy.

Ketoleucine is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of ketoleucine are associated with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465).",C6H10O3,130.1418,130.062994186,4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid,ketoisocaproate,816-66-0,CC(C)CC(=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C6H10O3/c1-4(2)3-5(7)6(8)9/h4H,3H2,1-2H3,(H,8,9)",BKAJNAXTPSGJCU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Liquid,69.0,DB03229,FDB030510,70.0,,48430.0,,C00019677,C00233,2K-4CH3-PENTANOATE,34334.0,,5663.0,4MOP,,"Tabuchi, Takeshi; Abe, Matazo.

In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, methionine is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine (PMID: 16702340 ). There is a general consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethioninemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimum recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g. acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established (PMID: 16702341 ). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. Acute doses of methionine can lead to acute increases in plasma homocysteine, which can be used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Sufficiently high doses of methionine can actually result in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times the normal amount resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid (PMID: 16702346 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, methionine can act as an atherogen and a metabotoxin. An atherogen is a compound that when present at chronically high levels causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methionine are associated with at least ten inborn errors of metabolism, including cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia due to defects in cobalamin metabolism, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency. Chronically elevated levels of methionine in infants can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems, delays in motor skills, sluggishness, muscle weakness, and liver problems. Many individuals with these metabolic disorders tend to develop cardiovascular disease later in life.

The conversion from tyrosine to 4-HPPA is catalyzed by tyrosine aminotransferase. Additionally, 4-HPPA can be converted to homogentisic acid which is one of the precursors to ochronotic pigment. The enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD) catalyzes the reaction that converts 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid to homogentisic acid. A deficiency in the catalytic activity of HPD is known to lead to tyrosinemia type III, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood tyrosine and massive excretion of tyrosine derivatives into urine. It has been shown that hawkinsinuria, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the excretion of 'hawkinsin,' may also be a result of HPD deficiency (PMID: 11073718). Moreover, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid is also found to be associated in phenylketonuria, which is also an inborn error of metabolism.

Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Hippuric acid is a normal component of urine and is typically increased with increased consumption of phenolic compounds (tea, wine, fruit juices). These phenols are converted into benzoic acid which is then converted into hippuric acid and excreted in the urine. Hippuric acid is the most frequently used biomarker in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene. This product of solvent biotransformation may be also found in the urine of individuals who have not been exposed to the solvent. A smaller fraction of the absorbed toluene is oxidized into aromatic compounds including ortho-cresol, which is not found in the urine of nonexposed individuals in a significant amount. The concentration of hippuric acid in the urine of individuals exposed to a low toluene concentration does not differ from that of individuals not exposed to the solvent. This has led to the conclusion that hippuric acid should not be utilized in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low levels of toluene in the air. Protein-bound organic acids such as hippuric acid are markedly accumulated in uremic plasma and produce defective protein binding of drugs (PMID: 9120876 , 8734460).

KYNA neuroprotective and anticonvulsive activities have been demonstrated in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Because of KYNA's neuromodulatory character, its involvement has been speculatively linked to the pathogenesis of a number of neurological conditions including those in the ageing process. Different patterns of abnormalities in various stages of KYNA metabolism in the CNS have been reported in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. In HIV-1-infected patients and in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis a marked rise of KYNA metabolism was seen. In the ageing process KYNA metabolism in the CNS of rats shows a characteristic pattern of changes throughout the life span. A marked increase of the KYNA content in the CNS occurs before the birth, followed by a dramatic decline on the day of birth. A low activity was seen during ontogenesis, and a slow and progressive enhancement occurs during maturation and ageing. This remarkable profile of KYNA metabolism alterations in the mammalian brain has been suggested to result from the development of the organisation of neuronal connections and synaptic plasticity, development of receptor recognition sites, maturation and ageing. There is significant evidence that KYNA can improve cognition and memory, but it has also been demonstrated that it interferes with working memory. Impairment of cognitive function in various neurodegenerative disorders is accompanied by profound reduction and/or elevation of KYNA metabolism. The view that enhancement of CNS KYNA levels could underlie cognitive decline is supported by the increased KYNA metabolism in Alzheimer's disease, by the increased KYNA metabolism in down's syndrome and the enhancement of KYNA function during the early stage of Huntington's disease. Kynurenic acid is the only endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist identified up to now, that mediates glutamatergic hypofunction. Schizophrenia is a disorder of dopaminergic neurotransmission, but modulation of the dopaminergic system by glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to play a key role. Despite the NMDA receptor antagonism, kynurenic acid also blocks, in lower doses, the nicotinergic acetycholine receptor, i.e., increased kynurenic acid levels can explain psychotic symptoms and cognitive deterioration. Kynurenic acid levels are described to be higher in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in critical central nervous system (CNS) regions of schizophrenics as compared to controls.

Indoles are compounds containing an indole moiety, which consists of pyrrole ring fused to benzene to form 2,3-benzopyrrole. Indoleacrylic acid is practically insoluble (in water) and a weak acidic compound (based on its pKa). Within the cell, indoleacrylic acid is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP). Indoleacrylic acid is best known as a plant growth hormone (a natural auxin), whereas its biological role in animals is still unknown. A two-stage production of this compound is likely: intestinal microorganisms catabolize tryptophan to indole derivatives which are then absorbed and converted into indoleacrylic acid and its glycine conjugate, indolylacryloylglycine (IAcrGly). Indolylacryloylglycine excretion in urine is especially pronounced in some myopathies, namely in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (PMID: 10707769). It has been recently found that indoleacrylic acid promotes intestinal epithelial barrier function and mitigates inflammatory responses. Stimulating indoleacrylic acid production could promote anti-inflammatory responses and have therapeutic benefits (PMID: 28704649).

It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. The participation of the nitrogen lone electron pair in the aromatic ring means that indole is not a base, and it does not behave like a simple amine. Indole is a microbial metabolite and it can be produced by bacteria as a degradation product of the amino acid tryptophan. It occurs naturally in human feces and has an intense fecal smell. At very low concentrations, however, indole has a flowery smell and is a constituent of many flower scents (such as orange blossoms) and perfumes. As a volatile organic compound, indole has been identified as a fecal biomarker of Clostridium difficile infection (PMID: 30986230). Natural jasmine oil, used in the perfume industry, contains around 2.5% of indole. Indole also occurs in coal tar. Indole has been found to be produced in a number of bacterial genera including Alcaligenes, Aspergillus, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas (PMID: 23194589, 2310183, 9680309). Indole plays a role in bacterial biofilm formation, bacterial motility, bacterial virulence, plasmid stability, and antibiotic resistance. It also functions as an intercellular signalling molecule (PMID: 26115989). Recently, it was determined that the bacterial membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase (HK) known as CpxA acts as a bacterial indole sensor to facilitate signalling (PMID: 31164470). It has been found that decreased indole concentrations in the gut promote bacterial pathogenesis, while increased levels of indole in the gut decrease bacterial virulence gene expression (PMID: 31164470).

It is likely produced from phenylpyruvate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. The D-form of this organic acid is typically derived from bacterial sources while the L-form is almost certainly endogenous. Levels of phenyllactate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of PLA in the urine or blood are often indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid (a precursor of phenylactate). In particular, excessive phenylalanine is typically metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid and then to phenyllactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain.

Indole-3-acetic acid derivatives are compounds containing an acetic acid (or a derivative) linked to the C3 carbon atom of an indole. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. In humans, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is a breakdown product of serotonin that is excreted in the urine and it also participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid can be biosynthesized from 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde; which is catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In addition, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and S-adenosylmethionine can be converted into 5-methoxyindoleacetate and S-adenosylhomocysteine through its interaction with the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid is also involved in the metabolism of tryptophan. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid has been found to be associated with several human diseases such as brunner syndrome, friedreich's ataxia, schizophrenia, and olivopontocerebral atrophy; 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorder sepiapterin reductase deficiency. Elevated levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in urine (>20 uM) are indicative of appendicitis and gastroenteritis (PMID: 11462886).

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetyl-L-alanine can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-alpha-Acetyl-L-alanine is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-alanine.  N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid. N-Acetyl-L-alanine is a product of the enzyme known as ribosomal alanine N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.128) which catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl CoA to proteins bearing an N-terminal alanine. N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylalanine can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). Excessive amounts N-acetyl amino acids can be detected in the urine with individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency, a genetic disorder (PMID: 16465618). These include N-acetylalanine (as well as N-acetylserine, N-acetylglutamine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylglycine, N-acetylmethionine and smaller amounts of N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylleucine, N-acetylvaline and N-acetylisoleucine. Aminoacylase I is a soluble homodimeric zinc binding enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free aliphatic amino acids from N-acetylated precursors. In humans, Aminoacylase I is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (ACY1) on chromosome 3p21 that consists of 15 exons (OMIM 609924). Individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency will experience convulsions, hearing loss and difficulty feeding (PMID: 16465618). ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylalanine, are classified as uremic toxins (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).

N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylaspartate can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free aspartic acid can also occur. In particular, N-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid can be synthesized in neurons from the amino acid aspartate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). Specifically, the enzyme known as aspartate N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.17) catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl CoA to the amino group of aspartate. N-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid is the second most concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate. The various functions served by N-acetylaspartic acid are still under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include (1) acting as a neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain, (2) serving as a source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes (the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons), (3) serving as a precursor for the synthesis of the important dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and (4) playing a potential role in energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria. High neurotransmitter (i.e. N-acetylaspartic acid) levels can lead to abnormal neural signaling, delayed or arrested intellectual development, and difficulties with general motor skills. When present in sufficiently high levels, N-acetylaspartic acid can be a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of N-acetylaspartic acid are associated with Canavan disease. Because N-acetylaspartic acid functions as an organic acid and high levels of organic acids can lead to a condition known as acidosis. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and flapping tremors.  Many N-acetylamino acids, including N-acetylaspartic acid, are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",C6H9NO5,175.1394,175.048072403,(2S)-2-acetamidobutanedioic acid,acetyl-L-aspartic acid,997-55-7,CC(=O)N[C@@H](CC(O)=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C6H9NO5/c1-3(8)7-4(6(11)12)2-5(9)10/h4H,2H2,1H3,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)(H,11,12)/t4-/m0/s1",OTCCIMWXFLJLIA-BYPYZUCNSA-N,Solid,58576.0,,FDB022260,65065.0,,21547.0,,,C01042,CPD-420,36685.0,N-acetylaspartic_acid,5776.0,NACASP,,"Montoro, Fernando; Calatayud, Jose; Vilar, Angel.

Primary alcohols are compounds in which a hydroxy group is bonded to a primary carbon, with the general structure RCOH (R=alkyl, aryl). Propyl alcohol is a colourless, volatile liquid that is fully miscible with water. It has a sweet odour and an alcoholic, fermented, fusel taste. Propyl alcohol exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Propanol can be produced through fermentation of sugars by bacteria and yeast and small amounts are produced by gut microflora. Propanol has been identified as a fecal biomarker of Clostridium difficile infection (PMID: 30986230). When ingested, 1-propanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to propionic acid leading to metabolic acidosis and an elevated anion gap (PMID: 18375643). It can be found in small amounts in alcoholic beverages such as wine. Industrially, the major use of 1-propanol is as a solvent as well as an intermediate in forming other industrially important compounds.  It is used as a carrier and extraction solvent for natural products, such as flavourings, vegetable oils, resins, waxes, and gums, and as a solvent for synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl butyral, cellulose esters, lacquers, and PVC adhesives.  Other solvent applications include the use of 1-propanol in the polymerization and spinning of acrylonitrile, in flexographic printing inks, and in the dyeing of wool.  1-Propanol is used for both its solvent and antiseptic properties in drugs and cosmetics, such as lotions, soaps, and nail polishes (IPCS INCHEM, EHC 102). Both 1-propanol and 2-propanol are often used in hand disinfectants as they have excellent bactericidal activity.  1-Propanol is used less in industry than 2-propanol as it is more expensive and it is a toxicant that has a similar taste to ethanol, so 2-propanol is used as its unpleasant smell discourages abuse.",C3H8O,60.095,60.057514878,propan-1-ol,propanol,71-23-8,CCCO,"InChI=1S/C3H8O/c1-2-3-4/h4H,2-3H2,1H3",BDERNNFJNOPAEC-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Liquid,1004.0,DB03175,FDB031044,1031.0,,28831.0,,,C05979,PROPANOL,,Propan-1-ol,5783.0,,,"Ito, Kenji; Katao, Masaaki.

The quinoline ring system is a double-ring structure composed of a benzene and a pyridine ring fused at two adjacent carbon atoms. Quinaldic acid is a quinoline having a carboxy group at the 2-position. It is a solid that is moderately soluble in water with a melting point of 156¬∞C.  Quinaldic acid is a metabolite of tryptophan degradation that is formed via the kynurenine pathway; it is formed through the dehydroxylation of the intermediate kynurenic acid (PMID: 13385219). It is excreted in urine, and its urine concentration is decreased in individuals suffering from chronic alcoholism (PMID: 25754126).  Quinaldic acid has been shown to inhibit proinsulin synthesis in pancreatic islet cells (PMID: 373355).

Derivatives of pimelic acid are involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid called lysine. Pimelic acid is one methylene longer than a related dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, a precursor to many polyesters and polyamides. Pimelic acid is essential for the synthesis of biotin (also called vitamin B7). Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing monocarboxylic acid that is made from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. Biotin is important in fatty acid synthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Biotin is found in a wide range of foods. Likewise, intestinal bacteria synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the host animal. Pimelic acid (which is the precursor for pimeloyl-CoA) is synthesized in many bacteria via a head-to-tail incorporation of acetate units through a modified fatty acid synthetic pathway using O-methyl esters disguised to resemble the canonical intermediates of the fatty acid synthetic pathway (PMID:21435937). Some bacteria and yeast synthesize pimelic acid not by biosynthesis, but via cleavage of longer chain fatty acids (such as linolenic acid) via a cytochrome P450-like enzyme (PMID:28196402, 21435937, 3236079).

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-valine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Valine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aliphatic amino acid. Valine was first isolated from casein in 1901 by Hermann Emil Fischer. The name valine comes from valeric acid, which in turn is named after the plant valerian due to the presence of valine in the roots of the plant. Valine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. L-valine is a branched chain amino acid (BCAA).  The BCAAs consist of leucine, valine and isoleucine (and occasionally threonine). BCAAs are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point at the beta-carbon position. BCAAs are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. BCAAs have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates (glucogenic), leucine solely to fats (ketogenic) and isoleucine being both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Like other branched-chain amino acids, the catabolism of valine starts with the removal of the amino group by transamination, giving alpha-ketoisovalerate, an alpha-keto acid, which is converted to isobutyryl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain Œ±-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. This is further oxidised and rearranged to succinyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt. Valine in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. Valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of valine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans (PMID: 25287287). Mice fed a valine deprivation diet for one day have improved insulin sensitivity and feeding of a valine deprivation diet for one week significantly decreases blood glucose levels (PMID: 24684822). In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of valine and the other branched-chain amino acids results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity (PMID: 29266268). In sickle-cell disease, valine substitutes for the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid in hemoglobin. Because valine is hydrophobic, the hemoglobin does not fold correctly.

Valeric acid is commonly found in human feces, with an average concentration of 2.4 umol/g feces (range of 0.6-3.8 umol/g) (PMID:6740214). Valeric acid is produced by the gut microbiota, typically Clostridia species and other gut bacterial species such as Megasphaera massiliensis MRx0029 (PMID:30052654) via the condensation of ethanol with propionic acid (PMID:18116989). Valeric acid is largely considered as a gut microbial metabolite. Recently, valeric acid has been found to exert strong gut protective effects. Studies involving mice that received high doses of radiation showed that valeric acid replenishment (via oral gavage) elevated the survival rate of irradiated mice, protected hematogenic organs (such as the thymus and spleen), improved gastrointestinal (GI) tract function and enhanced intestinal epithelial integrity (PMID:31931652 ).

Acetylcholine in vertebrates is the major transmitter at neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia, parasympathetic effector junctions, a subset of sympathetic effector junctions, and at many sites in the central nervous system.

ACh has been considered an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the carotid body (CB). Various nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors are present in both afferent nerve endings and glomus cells. Therefore, ACh can depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell membrane depending on the available receptor type in the vicinity.

Trimethylamine has a boiling point of 2.9 degree centigrade and is a gas at room temperature. Trimethylamine usually comes in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and its positively charged cation is called trimethylammonium cation. A common salt of trimethylamine is trimethylammonium chloride, a hygroscopic colorless solid. Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the fishy odor often associated with fouling fish, bacterial vagina infections, and bad breath. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline. Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize trimethylamine from food sources. Patients develop a characteristic fish odour of their sweat, urine, and breath after the consumption of choline-rich foods. Trimethylaminuria is an autosomal recessive disorder involving a trimethylamine oxidase deficiency. Trimethylaminuria has also been observed in a certain breed of Rhode Island Red chicken that produces eggs with a fishy smell. Trimethylamine in the urine is a biomarker for the consumption of legumes.

In particular, trimethylamine-N-oxide is biosynthesized endogenously from trimethylamine, which is derived from choline, which can be derived from dietary lecithin (phosphatidylcholines) or dietary carnitine. TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood. TMAO is an osmolyte that the body will use to counteract the effects of increased concentrations of urea (due to kidney failure) and high levels can be used as a biomarker for kidney problems. It has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID:22626821). Fish odor syndrome or trimethylaminuria is a defect in the production of the enzyme flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) causing incomplete breakdown of trimethylamine from choline-containing food into trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor. The concentration of TMAO in the blood increases after consuming foods containing carnitine or lecithin (phosphatidylcholines), if the bacteria that convert those substances to TMAO are present in the gut (PMID:23614584). High concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat, some energy drinks, and certain dietary supplements; lecithin is found in eggs and is commonly used as an ingredient in processed food. High levels of TMAO are found in many seafoods. Some types of normal gut bacteria (e.g. species of Acinetobacter) in the human gut convert dietary carnitine and dietary lecithin to TMAO (PMID:21475195). TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines, in the liver and in arterial wall. When TMAO is present, cholesterol metabolism is altered and there is an increased deposition of cholesterol within, and decreased removal of cholesterol from, peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall (PMID:23563705). Urinary TMAO is a biomarker for the consumption of fish, especially cold-water fish.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-tryptophan is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aromatic amino acid.  Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet.  The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. The minimum daily requirement for adults is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. There is 400 mg of tryptophan in a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low-fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg of tryptophan per pound (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Tryptophan is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Tryptophan is the precursor of both serotonin and melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by the pineal gland in animals, which regulates sleep and wakefulness. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor, and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin, and glutathione. Niacin (also known as vitamin B3) is an important metabolite of tryptophan. It is synthesized via kynurenine and quinolinic acids, which are products of tryptophan degradation. There are a number of conditions or diseases that are characterized by tryptophan deficiencies. For instance, fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, which reduces levels of tryptophan in the blood and leads to depression. High corn diets or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Hartnup's disease is a disorder in which tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Symptoms of Hartnup's disease include skin rashes, difficulty coordinating movements (cerebellar ataxia), and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or psychosis. Tryptophan supplements may be useful for treating Hartnup's disease. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan breakdown products (such as kynurenine) correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension, and anxiety states. Tryptophan plays a role in ""feast-induced"" drowsiness. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin, in turn, stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the bloodstream. The increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAAs and tryptophan), resulting in greater uptake of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin and the resulting serotonin is further metabolized into melatonin by the pineal gland, which promotes sleep. Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. This is because the transport system that brings tryptophan across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier also transports other amino acids which are contained in protein food sources. Under certain situations, tryptophan can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the brain and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of tryptophan can be found in glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I or GA1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. High levels of tryptophan have also been implicated in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of large amounts of L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain). It is thought that both tryptophan and certain unidentified tryptophan contaminants may contribute to EMS (PMID: 1763543 ). It has also been suggested that excessive tryptophan or elevation of its metabolites could play a role in amplifying some of the pathological features of EMS (PMID: 10721094 ). This pathological damage is further augmented by metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (a tryptophan degradation pathway).",C11H12N2O2,204.2252,204.089877638,(2S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid,L-tryptophan,73-22-3,N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C11H12N2O2/c12-9(11(14)15)5-7-6-13-10-4-2-1-3-8(7)10/h1-4,6,9,13H,5,12H2,(H,14,15)/t9-/m0/s1",QIVBCDIJIAJPQS-VIFPVBQESA-N,Solid,6066.0,DB00150,FDB002250,6305.0,,16828.0,,C00001396,C00078,TRP,33772.0,Tryptophan,5879.0,TRP_L,,"Amir-Heidari, Bagher; Thirlway, Jenny; Micklefield, Jason.

These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon).  Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (‚ÄìNH2) and carboxyl (‚ÄìCOOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. L-tryptophan is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) aromatic amino acid.  Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet.  The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. The minimum daily requirement for adults is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. There is 400 mg of tryptophan in a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low-fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg of tryptophan per pound (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Tryptophan is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Tryptophan is the precursor of both serotonin and melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by the pineal gland in animals, which regulates sleep and wakefulness. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor, and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin, and glutathione. Niacin (also known as vitamin B3) is an important metabolite of tryptophan. It is synthesized via kynurenine and quinolinic acids, which are products of tryptophan degradation. There are a number of conditions or diseases that are characterized by tryptophan deficiencies. For instance, fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, which reduces levels of tryptophan in the blood and leads to depression. High corn diets or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Hartnup's disease is a disorder in which tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Symptoms of Hartnup's disease include skin rashes, difficulty coordinating movements (cerebellar ataxia), and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or psychosis. Tryptophan supplements may be useful for treating Hartnup's disease. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan breakdown products (such as kynurenine) correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension, and anxiety states. Tryptophan plays a role in ""feast-induced"" drowsiness. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin, in turn, stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the bloodstream. The increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAAs and tryptophan), resulting in greater uptake of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin and the resulting serotonin is further metabolized into melatonin by the pineal gland, which promotes sleep.

N-acyl-alpha amino acids are compounds containing an alpha amino acid which bears an acyl group at its terminal nitrogen atom. N-Acetyl-L-glutamate can also be classified as an alpha amino acid or a derivatized alpha amino acid. Technically, N-Acetyl-L-glutamate is a biologically available N-terminal capped form of the proteinogenic alpha amino acid L-glutamic acid. N-Acetyl-L-glutamic acid is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. N-acetyl amino acids can be produced either via direct synthesis of specific N-acetyltransferases or via the proteolytic degradation of N-acetylated proteins by specific hydrolases. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process in eukaryotes that is involved in protection and stability of proteins (PMID: 16465618).  About 85% of all human proteins and 68% of all yeast proteins are acetylated at their N-terminus (PMID: 21750686). Several proteins from prokaryotes and archaea are also modified by N-terminal acetylation. The majority of eukaryotic N-terminal-acetylation reactions occur through N-acetyltransferase enzymes or NAT‚Äôs (PMID: 30054468).  These enzymes consist of three main oligomeric complexes NatA, NatB, and NatC, which are composed of at least a unique catalytic subunit and one unique ribosomal anchor. The substrate specificities of different NAT enzymes are mainly determined by the identities of the first two N-terminal residues of the target protein. The human NatA complex co-translationally acetylates N-termini that bear a small amino acid (A, S, T, C, and occasionally V and G) (PMID: 30054468). NatA also exists in a monomeric state and can post-translationally acetylate acidic N-termini residues (D-, E-). NatB and NatC acetylate N-terminal methionine with further specificity determined by the identity of the second amino acid.  N-acetylated amino acids, such as N-acetylglutamate can be released by an N-acylpeptide hydrolase from peptides generated by proteolytic degradation (PMID: 16465618). In addition to the NAT enzymes and protein-based acetylation, N-acetylation of free glutamic acid can also occur. In particular, N-Acetyl-L-glutamic acid can be biosynthesized from glutamate and acetylornithine by ornithine acetyltransferase, and from glutamic acid and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme known as N-acetylglutamate synthase. N-Acetyl-L-glutamic acid is the first intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of arginine in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes and a regulator of the urea cycle in vertebrates. In vertebrates, N-acetylglutamic acid is the allosteric activator molecule to mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) which is the first enzyme in the urea cycle. It triggers the production of the first urea cycle intermediate, a compound known as carbamyl phosphate. Notably the CPSI enzyme is inactive when N-acetylglutamic acid is not present. A deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthase or a genetic mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme will lead to urea cycle failure in which ammonia is not converted to urea, but rather accumulated in the blood leading to the condition called Type I hyperammonemia. Excessive amounts N-acetyl amino acids can be detected in the urine with individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency, a genetic disorder (PMID: 16465618). These include N-acetylalanine (as well as N-acetylserine, N-acetylglutamine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylglycine, N-acetylmethionine and smaller amounts of N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylleucine, N-acetylvaline and N-acetylisoleucine. Aminoacylase I is a soluble homodimeric zinc binding enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free aliphatic amino acids from N-acetylated precursors. In humans, Aminoacylase I is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (ACY1) on chromosome 3p21 that consists of 15 exons (OMIM 609924). Individuals with aminoacylase I deficiency will experience convulsions, hearing loss and difficulty feeding (PMID: 16465618). ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. Many N-acetylamino acids are classified as uremic toxins if present in high abundance in the serum or plasma (PMID: 26317986; PMID: 20613759). Uremic toxins are a diverse group of endogenously produced molecules that, if not properly cleared or eliminated by the kidneys, can cause kidney damage, cardiovascular disease and neurological deficits (PMID: 18287557).",C7H11NO5,189.1659,189.063722467,(2S)-2-acetamidopentanedioic acid,N-acetyl-L-glutamate,1188-37-0,CC(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C7H11NO5/c1-4(9)8-5(7(12)13)2-3-6(10)11/h5H,2-3H2,1H3,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)(H,12,13)/t5-/m0/s1",RFMMMVDNIPUKGG-YFKPBYRVSA-N,Solid,64077.0,DB04075,FDB031019,70914.0,,17533.0,,,C00624,ACETYL-GLU,,N-Acetylglutamic_acid,,ACGLU,,"hang, Xiaolin; Yang, Qiyong; Sun, Yuesheng.

Specifically it is a chromenone having the keto group located at the 2-position. A chromenone is a benzene molecule with two adjacent hydrogen atoms replaced by a lactone-like chain forming a second six-membered heterocycle that shares two carbons with the benzene ring. Coumarin is also described as a benzopyrone and is considered as a lactone. Coumarin is a colorless crystalline solid with a bitter taste and sweet odor resembling the scent of vanilla or the scent of newly-mowed or recently cut hay. It is a chemical poison found in many plants where it may serve as a chemical defense against predators. Coumarin occurs naturally in many plants and foods such as the tonka bean, woodruff, bison grass, cassia (bastard cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon), cinnamon, melilot (sweet clover), green tea, peppermint, celery, bilberry, lavender, honey (derived both from sweet clover and lavender), and carrots, as well as in beer, tobacco, wine, and other foodstuffs. Coumarin concentrations in these plants, spices, and foods range from <1 mg/kg in celery, to 7000 mg/kg in cinnamon, and up to 87,000 mg/kg in cassia. An estimate of human exposure to coumarin from the diet has been calculated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. Coumarin is used as an additive in perfumes and fragranced consumer products at concentrations ranging from <0.5% To 6.4% In fine fragrances to <0.01% In detergents. An estimate for systemic exposure of humans from the use of fragranced cosmetic products is 0.04 mg/kg BW/day, assuming complete dermal penetration. The use of coumarin as a food additive was banned by the FDA in 1954 based on reports of hepatotoxicity in rats. It has clinical value as the precursor for several anticoagulants, notably warfarin. Coumarins, as a class, are comprised of numerous naturally occurring benzo-alpha-pyrone compounds with important and diverse physiological activities. Due to its potential hepatotoxic effects in humans, the European Commission restricted coumarin from naturals as a direct food additive to 2 mg/kg food/day, with exceptions granting higher levels for alcoholic beverages, caramel, chewing gum, and certain 'traditional foods'. In addition to human exposure to coumarin from dietary sources and consumer products, coumarin is also used clinically as an antineoplastic and for the treatment of lymphedema and venous insufficiency. Exposure ranges from 11 mg/day for consumption of natural food ingredients to 7 g/day following clinical administration. Although adverse effects in humans following coumarin exposure are rare, and only associated with clinical doses, recent evidence indicates coumarin causes liver tumors in rats and mice and Clara cell toxicity and lung tumors in mice. The multiple effects as well as the ongoing human exposure to coumarin have resulted in a significant research effort focused on understanding the mechanism of coumarin induced toxicity/carcinogenicity and its human relevance. These investigations have revealed significant species differences in coumarin metabolism and toxicity such that the mechanism of coumarin induced effects in rodents, and the relevance of these findings for the safety assessment of coumarin exposure in humans are now better understood. In October 2004, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2004) reviewed coumarin to establish a tolerable daily intake (TDI) in foods. EFSA issued an opinion indicating that coumarin is not genotoxic, and that a threshold approach to safety assessment was most appropriate. EFSA recommended a TDI of 0 to 0.1 Mg/kg BW/day. Including dietary contributions, the total human exposure is estimated to be 0.06 Mg/kg/day. As a pharmaceutical, coumarin has been used in diverse applications with a wide variety of dosing regimens. Unlike coumadin and other coumarin derivatives, coumarin has no anti-coagulant activity. However, at low doses (typically 7 to 10 mg/day), coumarin has been used as a 'venotonic' to promote vein health and small venule blood flow. Additionally, coumarin has been used clinically in the treatment of high-protein lymphedema arising from various etiologies. (PMID: 16203076).

Usually 4-nitrophenol exists as a mixture of these two forms. 4-Nitrophenol can be used as a pH indicator and as an intermediate in the synthesis of paracetamol. Itis also used as the precursor for the preparation of phenetidine and acetophenetidine, indicators, and raw materials for fungicides. Bioaccumulation of this compound rarely occurs. In peptide synthesis, carboxylate ester derivatives of 4-nitrophenol may serve as activated components for construction of amide moieties. 4-Nitrophenol is a potentially toxic compound: it can cause eyes, skin, and respiratory tract irritations. It may also cause inflammation of those parts. It has a delayed interaction with blood and forms methaemoglobin which is responsible for methemoglobinemia -which is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen-, potentially causing cyanosis, confusion, and unconsciousness. When ingested, it causes abdominal pain and vomiting. Prolonged contact with skin may cause allergic response. Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of 4-nitrophenol are not known. The LD50 in mice is 282 mg/kg and in rats is 202 mg/kg. Outside of the human body, 4-Nitrophenol has been detected, but not quantified in cow milk.

DOPAC is a neuronal metabolite of dopamine (DA). DA undergoes monoamine oxidase-catalyzed oxidative deamination to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), which is metabolized primarily into DOPAC via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The biotransformation of DOPAL is critical as previous studies have demonstrated this DA-derived aldehyde to be a reactive electrophile and toxic to dopaminergic cells. Known inhibitors of mitochondrial ALDH2, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) inhibit ALDH2-mediated oxidation of the endogenous neurotoxin DOPAL. 4HNE is one of the resulting products of oxidative stress, thus linking oxidative stress to the uncontrolled production of an endogenous neurotoxin relevant to Parkinson's disease. In early-onset Parkinson disease, there is markedly reduced activities of both monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. The amount of DOPAC, which is produced during dopamine oxidation by MAO, is greatly reduced as a result of increased parkin overexpression. Administration of methamphetamine to animals causes loss of DA terminals in the brain and significant decreases in dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum. Renal dopamine produced in the residual tubular units may be enhanced during a sodium challenge, thus behaving appropriately as a compensatory natriuretic hormone; however, the renal dopaminergic system in patients afflicted with renal parenchymal disorders should address parameters other than free urinary dopamine, namely the urinary excretion of L-DOPA and metabolites. DOPAC is one of the major phenolic acids formed during human microbial fermentation of tea, citrus, and soy flavonoid supplements. DOPAC exhibits a considerable antiproliferative effect in LNCaP prostate cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of DOPAC may be due to its catechol structure. A similar association of the catechol moiety in the B-ring with antiproliferative activity was demonstrated for flavanones (PMID:16956664, 16455660, 8561959, 11369822, 10443478, 16365058).

Chemically it is based on a pyridine ring structure, with hydroxyl, methyl, aminomethyl, and hydroxymethyl substituents. It differs from pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. The hydroxyl at position 3 and aminomethyl group at position 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a variety of chemical properties, including the scavenging of free radical species and carbonyl species formed in sugar and lipid degradation and chelation of metal ions that catalyze Amadori reactions. Pyridoxamine, also known as PM, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridoxamine 5'-phosphates. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a pyridoxamine that carries a phosphate group at the 5'-position. Within humans, pyridoxamine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, pyridoxamine can be converted into pyridoxal; which is mediated by the enzyme pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase. In addition, pyridoxamine can be converted into pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate; which is catalyzed by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase. Pyridoxamine also inhibits the formation of advanced lipoxidation endproducts during lipid peroxidation reactions by reaction with dicarbonyl intermediates. In humans, pyridoxamine is involved in vitamin B6 metabolism. Outside of the human body, pyridoxamine has been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as nutmegs, sparkleberries, fennels, turmerics, and swiss chards. Pyridoxamine inhibits the Maillard reaction and can block the formation of advanced glycation endproducts, which are associated with medical complications of diabetes. Pyridoxamine is hypothesized to trap intermediates in the formation of Amadori products released from glycated proteins, possibly preventing the breakdown of glycated proteins by disrupting the catalysis of this process through disruptive interactions with the metal ions crucial to the redox reaction. One research study found that pyridoxamine specifically reacts with the carbonyl group in Amadori products, but inhibition of post-Amadori reactions (that can lead to advanced glycation endproducts) is due in much greater part to the metal chelation effects of pyridoxamine.

Phosphocreatine undergoes irreversible cyclization and dehydration to form creatinine at a fractional rate of 0.026 per day, thus forming approximately 2 g creatinine/day in an adult male. This is the amount of creatine that must be provided either from dietary sources or by endogenous synthesis to maintain the body pool of (creatine and) phosphocreatine. Creatine is an amino acid that plays a vital role as phosphocreatine in regenerating adenosine triphosphate in skeletal muscle to energize muscle contraction. Creatine is phosphorylated to phosphocreatine in muscle in a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme is in highest concentration in muscle and nerve. Oral administration increases muscle stores. During the past decade, creatine has assumed prominence as an ergogenic (and legal) aid for professional and elite athletes. Most (~ 95%) of the total body creatine-phosphocreatine pool is in muscle (more in skeletal muscle than in smooth muscle) and amounts to 120 g (or 925 mmol) in a 70 kg adult male. Approximately 60-67% of the content in resting muscle is in the phosphorylated form. This generates enough ATP at the myofibrillar apparatus to power about 4 seconds of muscle contraction in exercise. Phosphocreatine reacts with ADP to yield ATP and creatine; the reversible reaction is catalyzed by creatine kinase. phosphocreatine is the chief store of high-energy phosphates in muscle. Thus, this reaction, which permits the rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP, is the immediate source of energy in muscle contraction. During rest, metabolic processes regenerate phosphocreatine stores. In normal muscle, ATP that is broken down to ADP is immediately rephosphorylated to ATP. Thus, phosphocreatine serves as a reservoir of ATP-synthesizing potential. phosphocreatine is the only fuel available to precipitously regenerate ATP during episodes of rapid fluctuations in demand. The availability of phosphocreatine likely limits muscle performance during brief, high-power exercise, i.e., maximal exercise of short duration. With near maximal isometric contraction, the rate of utilization of phosphocreatine declines after 1-2 seconds of contraction, prior to the glycolysis peak at approximately 3 seconds (PMID:10079702).",C4H10N3O5P,211.1131,211.035806957,2-(N-methyl-N'-phosphonocarbamimidamido)acetic acid,creatine-phosphate,67-07-2,CN(CC(O)=O)C(=N)NP(O)(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C4H10N3O5P/c1-7(2-3(8)9)4(5)6-13(10,11)12/h2H2,1H3,(H,8,9)(H4,5,6,10,11,12)",DRBBFCLWYRJSJZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Solid,567.0,DB13191,FDB022665,587.0,,17287.0,,,C02305,CREATINE-P,1594794.0,Phosphocreatine,6288.0,PCREAT,,"Hou, Lixiang.

Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug in the world. 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily, consuming 164 mg on average. Caffeine is mostly is consumed in the form of coffee. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans.  Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance and cycling power output (PMID: 32551869). At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory effects, and adenosine antagonism by caffeine results in effects that are generally stimulatory. Some physiological effects associated with caffeine administration include central nervous system stimulation, acute elevation of blood pressure, increased metabolic rate, and diuresis. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that caffeine modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance, studies indicate that caffeine and its major metabolite paraxanthine suppress neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and also suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from human blood. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress human lymphocyte function as indicated by reduced T-cell proliferation and impaired production of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th3 (IL-10) cytokines. Studies also indicate that caffeine suppresses antibody production. The evidence suggests that at least some of the immunomodulatory actions of caffeine are mediated via inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE), and consequential increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Overall, these studies indicate that caffeine, like other members of the methylxanthine family, is largely anti-inflammatory in nature, and based on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, many of its immunomodulatory effects occur at concentrations that are relevant to normal human consumption. (PMID: 16540173). Caffeine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and distributed to all tissues, including the brain. Caffeine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, where the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2 accounts for almost 95% of the primary metabolism of caffeine. CYP1A2-catalyzed 3-demethylation of caffeine results in the formation of 1,7-dimethylxanthine (paraxanthine). Paraxanthine may be demethylated by CYP1A2 to form 1-methylxanthine, which may be oxidized to 1-methyluric acid by xanthine oxidase. Paraxanthine may also be hydroxylated by CYP2A6 to form 1,7-dimethyluric acid, or acetylated by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to form 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil, an unstable compound that may be deformylated nonenzymatically to form 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but a recent analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (=240 ml) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg. Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot. (PMID: 16507475).

P-cresol is a cresol that consists of toluene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4. It is a metabolite of aromatic amino acid metabolism produced by intestinal microflora in humans and animals. It has a role as a uremic toxin, a human metabolite and an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a colourless solid that is widely used intermediate in the production of other chemicals. It is a derivative of phenol and is an isomer of o-cresol and m-cresol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (PMID:10570076). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure (PMID:11169029). At concentrations encountered during uremia, p-cresol inhibits phagocyte function and decreases leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. (PMID:14681860). p-Cresol can be found in Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterobacter and Lactobacillus (PMID:2394806; PMID:30208103).

Nicotine alkaloids are also found in the leaves of the coca plant. Nicotine constitutes 0.3 to 5% of the tobacco plant by dry weight, with biosynthesis taking place in the root and accumulation in the leaves. It is a potent neurotoxin with particular specificity to insects; therefore nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past and nicotine derivatives such as imidacloprid continue to be widely used. It has been noted that the majority of people diagnosed with schizophrenia smoke tobacco. Estimates for the number of schizophrenics that smoke range from 75% to 90%. It was recently argued that the increased level of smoking in schizophrenia may be due to a desire to self-medicate with nicotine. More recent research has found the reverse: it is a risk factor without long-term benefit, used only for its short-term effects. However, research on nicotine as administered through a patch or gum is ongoing. As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and can cross the blood-brain barrier. On average, it takes about seven seconds for the substance to reach the brain. The half-life of nicotine in the body is around 2 hours. The amount of nicotine inhaled with tobacco smoke is a fraction of the amount contained in the tobacco leaves (most of the substance is destroyed by the heat). The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. For chewing tobacco, often called dip, snuff, or sinus, which is held in the mouth between the lip and gum, the amount released into the body tends to be much greater than smoked tobacco. The currently available literature indicates that nicotine, on its own, does not promote the development of cancer in healthy tissue and has no mutagenic properties. Its teratogenic properties have not yet been adequately researched, and while the likelihood of birth defects caused by nicotine is believed to be very small or nonexistent, nicotine replacement product manufacturers recommend consultation with a physician before using a nicotine patch or nicotine gum while pregnant or nursing. However, nicotine and the increased acetylcholinic activity it causes have been shown to impede apoptosis, which is one of the methods by which the body destroys unwanted cells (programmed cell death). Since apoptosis helps to remove mutated or damaged cells that may eventually become cancerous, the inhibitory actions of nicotine create a more favourable environment for cancer to develop. Thus, nicotine plays an indirect role in carcinogenesis. It is also important to note that its addictive properties are often the primary motivating factor for tobacco smoking, contributing to the proliferation of cancer. Nicotine is a highly toxic alkaloid. It is the prototypical agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors where it dramatically stimulates neurons and ultimately blocks synaptic transmission. Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke. Nicotine is a hygroscopic, oily liquid that is miscible with water in its base form. As a nitrogenous base, nicotine forms salts with acids that are usually solid and water soluble. Nicotine easily penetrates the skin. As shown by the physical data, free base nicotine will burn at a temperature below its boiling point, and its vapours will combust at 95 °C in the air despite a low vapour pressure. Because of this, most nicotine is burned when a cigarette is smoked; however, enough is inhaled to provide the desired effects. Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible for the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine. Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing an influx of sodium which causes depolarization of the cell and activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar. Cotinine is a byproduct of the metabolism of nicotine which remains in the blood for up to 48 hours and can be used as an indicator of a person's exposure to smoke. In high doses, nicotine will cause a blocking of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the reason for its toxicity and its effectiveness as an insecticide. In lower concentrations, the substance acts as a stimulant in mammals and is one of the main factors responsible for the dependence-forming and energy-boosting properties of tobacco smoking.",C10H14N2,162.2316,162.115698458,3-[(2S)-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]pyridine,nicoderm CQ,54-11-5,[H][C@]1(CCCN1C)C1=CC=CN=C1,"InChI=1S/C10H14N2/c1-12-7-3-5-10(12)9-4-2-6-11-8-9/h2,4,6,8,10H,3,5,7H2,1H3/t10-/m0/s1",SNICXCGAKADSCV-JTQLQIEISA-N,Liquid,80863.0,DB00184,FDB003968,89594.0,,17688.0,,C00002057,C00745,NICOTINE,,Nicotine,1526.0,,,"Breuer E; Melumad D  A one-step synthesis of nicotine from cyclopropyl 3-pyridyl ketone.

They are a widely occurring natural and manufactured group of aromatic organic compounds which are categorized as phenols (sometimes called phenolics). Depending on the temperature, cresols can be solid or liquid because they have melting points not far from room temperature. Like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by long exposure to air and the impurities often give cresols a yellowish to brownish red tint. Cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a ""medicine"" smell. Cresol solutions are used as household cleaners and disinfectants, perhaps most famously under the trade name Lysol. In the past, cresol solutions have been used as antiseptics in surgery, but they have been largely displaced in this role by less toxic compounds. Lysol was also advertised as a disinfecting vaginal douche in mid-twentieth century America. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in brown mixtures such as creosote and cresylic acids, which are wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Most exposures to cresols are at very low levels that are not harmful. When cresols are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death. Breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. Aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times. Ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system. Skin contact with high levels of cresols can burn the skin and damage the kidneys, liver, blood, brain, and lungs. m-Cresol is a microbial metabolite that can be found in Lysinibacillus.",C7H8O,108.1378,108.057514878,3-methylphenol,M-cresol,108-39-4,CC1=CC=CC(O)=C1,"InChI=1S/C7H8O/c1-6-3-2-4-7(8)5-6/h2-5,8H,1H3",RLSSMJSEOOYNOY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,Liquid,21105871.0,DB01776,FDB008788,342.0,,17231.0,,C00035128,C01467,CPD-112,,M-cresol,,,,,HMDB0002048

It is used as a local anesthetic and to reduce pain associated with Lidocaine injection. Also, it is used in the manufacture of other benzyl compounds, as a pharmaceutical aid, and in perfumery and flavoring. Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol used in a wide variety of cosmetic formulations as a fragrance component, preservative, solvent, and viscosity-decreasing agent. Benzyl alcohol is metabolized to Benzoic Acid, which reacts with glycine and excreted as hippuric acid in the human body. Acceptable daily intakes were established by the World Health Organization at 5 mg/kg for Benzyl alcohol. No adverse effects of benzyl alcohol have been seen in chronic exposure animal studies using rats and mice. Effects of Benzyl Alcohol in chronic exposure animal studies are limited to reduced feed intake and reduced growth. Some differences have been noted in one reproductive toxicity study using mice, but these were limited to lower maternal body weights and decreased mean litter weights. Another study also noted that fetal weight was decreased compared to controls, but a third study showed no differences between control and benzyl alcohol-treated groups. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with an increased number of resorptions and malformations in hamsters, but there have been no reproductive or developmental toxicity findings in studies using mice and rats. Genotoxicity tests for benzyl alcohol are mostly negative, but there were some assays that were positive. Carcinogenicity studies, however, were negative. Clinical data indicates that benzyl alcohol can produce nonimmunologic contact urticaria and nonimmunologic immediate contact reactions, characterized by the appearance of wheals, erythema, and pruritis. 5% benzyl alcohol can elicit a reaction. Benzyl alcohol is not a sensitizer at 10%. Benzyl alcohol could be used safely at concentrations up to 5%, but that manufacturers should consider the nonimmunologic phenomena when using benzyl alcohol in cosmetic formulations designed for infants and children. Additionally, Benzyl alcohol is considered safe up to 10% for use in hair dyes. The limited body exposure, the duration of use, and the frequency of use are considered in concluding that the nonimmunologic reactions would not be a concern. Because of the wide variety of product types in which benzyl alcohol may be used, it is likely that inhalation may be a route of exposure. The available safety tests are not considered sufficient to support the safety of benzyl alcohol in formulations where inhalation is a route of exposure. Inhalation toxicity data are needed to complete the safety assessment of benzyl alcohol where inhalation can occur.

Isoflavones compounds, such as genistein and daidzein, are found in a number of plants, but soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein are the primary food source. Genistein is a natural bioactive compound derived from legumes and has drawn because of its potentially beneficial effects on some human degenerative diseases. It has a weak estrogenic effect and is a well-known non-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor at pharmacological doses. Epidemiological studies show that genistein intake is inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Data suggests a protective role of genistein in cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms of the genistein action on vascular protective effects are unclear. Past extensive studies exploring its hypolipidemic effect resulted in contradictory data. Genistein also is a relatively poor antioxidant. However, genistein protects against pro-inflammatory factor-induced vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction and inhibits leukocyte-endothelium interaction, thereby modulating vascular inflammation, a major event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Genistein exerts a non-genomic action by targeting on important signaling molecules in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Genistein rapidly activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide in ECs. This genistein effect is novel since it is independent of its known effects, but mediated by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) cascade. Genistein directly stimulates the plasma membrane-associated adenylate cyclases, leading to activation of the cAMP signaling pathway. In addition, genistein activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, ligand-activated nuclear receptors important to normal vascular function. Furthermore, genistein reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by attenuating the expression of ROS-producing enzymes. These findings reveal the roles for genistein in the regulation of vascular function and provide a basis for further investigating its therapeutic potential for inflammatory-related vascular disease.

Cyclohexanone is occasionally found as a volatile component of human urine.

In some cases differences up to an order of magnitude are observed. Although some of these changes may have dietary origins, others seem to be characteristic of the individual. Cyclohexanone is obtained through oxidation of cyclohexane or dehydrogenation of phenol. Approx. 95% of its manufacturing is used for the production of nylon. Information on toxicity to human beings is fragmentary. Acute exposure is characterized by irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. In two persons, drowsiness and renal impairment were found; however, these workers were also exposed to other compounds. Hepatic disorders were found in a group of workers exposed for over five years. In animals, cyclohexanone is characterized by relatively low acute toxicity (DL50 by intragastric administration is approximately 2 g/kg body wt.). Effects on the central nervous system (CNS) were found (narcosis), as well as irritation of the eyes and skin.

Outside of the human body, oxidized glutathione has been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as leeks, star anises, mamey sapotes, climbing beans, and common persimmons. Oxidized glutathione is a glutathione dimer formed by a disulfide bond between the cysteine sulfhydryl side chains during the course of being oxidized. Glutathione participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. Glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione into S-D-lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione into glutathione and D-lactate.",C20H32N6O12S2,612.631,612.151961898,(2S)-2-amino-4-{[(1R)-2-{[(2R)-2-[(4S)-4-amino-4-carboxybutanamido]-2-[(carboxymethyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]disulfanyl}-1-[(carboxymethyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]carbamoyl}butanoic acid,glutathione disulfide,27025-41-8,N[C@@H](CCC(=O)N[C@@H](CSSC[C@H](NC(=O)CC[C@H](N)C(O)=O)C(=O)NCC(O)=O)C(=O)NCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C20H32N6O12S2/c21-9(19(35)36)1-3-13(27)25-11(17(33)23-5-15(29)30)7-39-40-8-12(18(34)24-6-16(31)32)26-14(28)4-2-10(22)20(37)38/h9-12H,1-8,21-22H2,(H,23,33)(H,24,34)(H,25,27)(H,26,28)(H,29,30)(H,31,32)(H,35,36)(H,37,38)/t9-,10-,11-,12-/m0/s1",YPZRWBKMTBYPTK-BJDJZHNGSA-N,Solid,58835.0,DB03310,FDB023147,65359.0,,17858.0,,,C00127,OXIDIZED-GLUTATHIONE,,Glutathione disulfide,,GTHOX,,"Saito, Susumu; Nishijima, Kunihide; Kataoka, Katsuyuki; Aoyanagi, Yoshinori; Fukuda, Yoji; Ito, Homare.

Seleno-compounds present in plants may have a profound effect on the health of animals and human subjects. It is now known that the total Se content cannot be used as an indication of its efficacy, but knowledge of individual selenocompounds is necessary to fully assess the significance. Thus, speciation of the seleno-compounds has moved to the forefront. Since animals and man are dependent upon plants for their nutritional requirements, this makes the types of seleno-compounds in plants even more critical. Se enters the food chain through incorporation into plant proteins, mostly as selenocysteine and selenomethionine at normal Se levels. There are two possible pathways for the catabolism of selenomethionine. One is the transsulfuration pathway via selenocystathionine to produce selenocysteine, which in turn is degraded into H2Se by the enzyme beta-lyase. The other pathway is the transamination-decarboxylation pathway.

It is a white odorless solid, soluble in water and several organic solvents. It is produced industrially as a precursor to polyacrylamides, which find many uses as water-soluble thickeners and flocculation agents. It is highly toxic, likely to be carcinogenic,and partly for that reason it is mainly handled as an aqueous solution. It is a chemical used in many industries around the world and more recently was found to form naturally in foods cooked at high temperatures. Acrylamide is a neurotoxicant, reproductive toxicant, and carcinogen in animal species. Only the neurotoxic effects have been observed in humans and only at high levels of exposure in occupational settings. The mechanism underlying neurotoxic effects of ACR may be basic to the other toxic effects seen in animals. This mechanism involves interference with the kinesin-related motor proteins in nerve cells or with fusion proteins in the formation of vesicles at the nerve terminus and eventual cell death. Neurotoxicity and resulting behavioral changes can affect reproductive performance of ACR-exposed laboratory animals with resulting decreased reproductive performance. Further, the kinesin motor proteins are important in sperm motility, which could alter reproduction parameters. Effects on kinesin proteins could also explain some of the genotoxic effects on ACR. These proteins form the spindle fibers in the nucleus that function in the separation of chromosomes during cell division. This could explain the clastogenic effects of the chemical noted in a number of tests for genotoxicity and assays for germ cell damage. Other mechanisms underlying ACR-induced carcinogenesis or nerve toxicity are likely related to an affinity for sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Binding of the sulfhydryl groups could inactive proteins/enzymes involved in DNA repair and other critical cell functions. Direct interaction with DNA may or may not be a major mechanism for cancer induction in animals. The DNA adducts that form do not correlate with tumor sites and ACR is mostly negative in gene mutation assays except at high doses that may not be achievable in the diet. All epidemiologic studies fail to show any increased risk of cancer from either high-level occupational exposure or the low levels found in the diet. In fact, two of the epidemiologic studies show a decrease in cancer of the large bowel. A number of risk assessment studies were performed to estimate increased cancer risk. The results of these studies are highly variable depending on the model. There is universal consensus among international food safety groups in all countries that examined the issue of ACR in the diet that not enough information is available at this time to make informed decisions on which to base any regulatory action. Too little is known about levels of this chemical in different foods and the potential risk from dietary exposure. Avoidance of foods containing ACR would result in worse health issues from an unbalanced diet or pathogens from under cooked foods. There is some consensus that low levels of ACR in the diet are not a concern for neurotoxicity or reproductive toxicity in humans, although further research is need to study the long-term, low-level cumulative effects on the nervous system. Any relationship to cancer risk from dietary exposure is hypothetical at this point and awaits more definitive studies.

In recent years, a large amount of experimental and some clinical data have accumulated regarding the effects of flavonoids on the endothelium under physiological and pathological conditions.

Since its discovery in invertebrates, free D-aspartate (D-Asp) has been identified in a variety of organisms, including microorganisms, plants, and lower animals, mammals and humans. D-Asp in mammalian tissues is present in specific cells, indicating the existence of specific molecular components that regulate D-Asp levels and localization in tissues. In the rat adrenal medulla, D-Asp is closely associated with adrenaline-cells (A-cells), which account for approximately 80% of the total number of chromaffin cells in the tissue, and which make and store adrenaline. D-Asp appears to be absent from noradrenaline-cells (NA-cells), which comprise approximately 20% of the total number of chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, and which make and store noradrenaline. D-aspartate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.1, D-AspO), which catalyzes oxidative deamination of D-Asp, appears to be present only in NA-cells, suggesting that the lack of D-Asp in these cells is due to D-Asp oxidase-mediated metabolism of D-Asp. In the rat adrenal cortex, the distribution of D-Asp changes during development. It has been suggested that developmental changes in the localization of D-Asp reflects the participation of D-Asp in the development and maturation of steroidogenesis in rat adrenal cortical cells. D-Asp is involved in steroid hormone synthesis and secretion in mammals as well. D-Asp is synthesized intracellularly, most likely by Asp racemase (EC 5.1.1.13). Endogenous D-Asp apparently has two different intracellular localization patterns: cytoplasmic and vesicular. D-Asp release can occur through three distinct pathways: 1) spontaneous, continuous release of cytoplasmic D-Asp, which is not associated with a specific stimulus; 2) release of cytoplasmic D-Asp via a volume-sensitive organic anion channel that connects the cytoplasm and extracellular space; 3) exocytotic discharge of vesicular D-Asp. D-Asp can be released via a mechanism that involves the L-Glu transporter. D-Asp is thus apparently in dynamic flux at the cellular level to carry out its physiological function(s) in mammals (PMID:16755369).",C4H7NO4,133.1027,133.037507717,(2R)-2-aminobutanedioic acid,D-aspartic acid,1783-96-6,N[C@H](CC(O)=O)C(O)=O,"InChI=1S/C4H7NO4/c5-2(4(8)9)1-3(6)7/h2H,1,5H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/t2-/m1/s1",CKLJMWTZIZZHCS-UWTATZPHSA-N,Solid,75697.0,DB02655,FDB023933,83887.0,DAS,17364.0,,,C00402,CPD-302,34874.0,Aspartic acid,15.0,,,"Harada, Kaoru.

Phytoalexins are antibiotics produced by plants that are under attack. Phytoalexins tend to fall into several classes including terpenoids, glycosteroids, and alkaloids; however, researchers often find it convenient to extend the definition to include all phytochemicals that are part of the plant's defensive arsenal. Phytoalexins produced in plants act as toxins to the attacking organism. They may puncture the cell wall, delay maturation, disrupt metabolism, or prevent the reproduction of the pathogen in question. However, phytoalexins are often targeted to specific predators; a plant that has anti-insect phytoalexins may not have the ability to repel a fungal attack. 3-Indoleacetonitrile is common in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.

Phenethylamine can be biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine by enzymatic decarboxylation. It is also found in many foods such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation. However trace amounts from food are quickly metabolized by the enzyme MAO-B (into phenylacetic acid), preventing significant concentrations from reaching the brain.

These are monoterpenoids containing at least one aromatic ring. Monoterpenoids are terpenes that contain 10 carbon atoms and are comprised of two isoprene units. The biosynthesis of monoterpenes is known to occur mainly through the methyl-erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastids. Geranyl diphosphate (GPP) is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of cyclic monoterpenes. GPP undergoes several cyclization reactions to yield a diverse number of cyclic arrangements. 5-Isopropyl-2-methylphenol is a very hydrophobic molecule, practically insoluble in water, but fairly soluble in organic solvents. Thus, 5-Isopropyl-2-methylphenol is considered to be an isoprenoid lipid molecule. Thymol is found in the essential oil of thyme and in the essential oils of several different plants. It can be extracted from Thymus vulgaris (common thyme), Ajwain and various other kinds of plants as a white crystalline substance of a pleasant aromatic odor and strong antiseptic properties. Thymol also provides the distinctive, strong flavor of the culinary herb thyme, also produced from T. vulgaris.
